AUG,2020,Mr. Del Bigtree,"Founder, Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) ","My name is Del Bigtree. I speak for the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN), which is my nonprofit. I would like to address our concerns about the safety trials that are taking place on all of the vaccines for COVID-19. Specifically, I want to point out that I think the ACIP committee— that you sit in an unprecedented moment of the potential of having one of the greatest accidents in science that has ever taken place, and that would be rushing this vaccine given what we know about the science. Of course, I’m talking about the possibility for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement, cellular- mediated enhancement, Th2. All of these problems which have appeared in Dengue vaccine, which killed over a hundred people in the Dengue vaccine campaign in the Philippines; the RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) vaccine program, which was discontinued because of the death of children; and this occurring in virtually every animal trial over the last 20 years. This is not any other vaccine. This is one of the most dangerous vaccines ever attempted, To know that we are using warp speed and that we have Governors around this country and leaders around the world say they will immediately mandate this product upon all of their population means that we could have a vaccine that could potentially kill unknown, untold amounts of people because their bodies don't protect them after this vaccine but, in fact, enhance the problem. When I look at the trials that are taking place—when we look at the Moderna trials, we are not doing challenge studies on human beings. The challenge studies are being done on macaque monkeys, which are known to have a very mild reaction, which is not the way to, you know, to weed out a problem. We’re using the young monkeys and even then, we did not test them. We did not challenge them after the first vaccine, which only created binding antibodies, which is one of the theories that creates the immune enhancement. We only tested after they knew they had neutralizing antibodies, which only took place two weeks after the booster shot, which means we are allowing the pharmaceutical industry to cherry-pick their moments of research to make their vaccine look good. Of course, they’re going to try and make it look good. They stand to make potentially hundreds of billions of dollars. If not trillions of dollars, off of the vaccines should they be selected. Under these circumstances, I would like to see more rigor from the CDC and demanding more constant testing. The United States of America is putting billions of dollars into these vaccine trials. We should be having all sorts of animal trials on a constant basis, truly challenging to make sure that we have overcome immune enhancement. If we have not, we could seriously put our species at risk. And the only conversations I hear going on is, “How quickly can we get it to everybody?” And the risk of the disease—what about the risk of this vaccine? That is in your hands and you will be remembered in history should you make a diabolical, catastrophic mistake. Thank you very much.

AUG,2020,Andre Montoya-Barthelemy,"MD,HealthPartners Occupational and Environmental Medicine (OEM) ","My name is Andre Montoya-Barthelemy. First of all, all of those held in jails, prisons, and detention centers really must be included in Tier 1 of the ACIP recommendations for COVID vaccination. As I said, I'm Andre Montoya-Barthelemy, physician with specific training in public health and epidemiology and I lead a task force investigating the hazards of the correctional environment. Today, I represent leaders of the American College of Correctional Physicians (ACCP) and the American Association of Public Health Physicians (AAPHP). Together, we’ve reviewed the ACIP’s current plan for COVID vaccination. We have to recommend modification of your criteria based on a fundamental public health principle that individuals are at high risk for COVID based on structural and environmental forces which promote transmission of the virus, as well as their individual high-risk health conditions. Increased risk is increased risk and it leads to disease regardless. Let me be more specific, though. Individuals who live in congregate settings including group homes, shelters, long-term care facilities (LTCF), prisons, jails, and detention centers must be provided the protection against the very environment in which they live. In these settings, vaccinations can do more. Today, our group advocates specifically for prisoners. We look at their environment, possibly overcrowded facilities where social distancing is extremely challenging. Where masks, hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies, and even soap are rationed and restricted. Where a visit to a clinic can cost a full week of your prison wages. Recent research demonstrates death rates up to 3 times higher and case rates more than 5 times higher than the general population. Vaccination here will go farther. It will save lives. And as we look at our windows, many of the COVID hotspots in our country are in prisons. Although often considered isolated, inmates are regularly released from prisons and jails and correctional staff daily travel home to their families. Without a damper on the transmission inside the facility, they’ll act as incubators storing and releasing financial, legal, and public health burden back into the general population. The solution is what in medicine we call “source control.” Without it, transmission will continue as long as the hotspots remain uncontrolled. As a physician, I care for the individuals who live and work under the constant and invisible threat of this pandemic. As a public health professional, I’m obligated to apply the fundamental principles to arrest spread in the community. As our government-appointed advisors, you have a very difficult position—a responsibility to balance both of those imperatives. It is terribly difficult, but vaccination of inmates accomplishes all three: good medicine, good public health, and good governance. So, I’m imploring you to protect those individuals living in congregate settings, especially those in jails, prisons, and detention centers. Include them in Tier 1 of your COVID vaccination schedule.

AUG,2020,Santa Ric Erwin,"Chairman, Board of Directors,Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas (FORBS) ","Thank you. Not since the depths of the Great Depression or the Darkest Hour of World War II have so many sane and sober adults wondered aloud whether America may be facing a year without Christmas. Every professional Santa has a story or 20 about the kid who asks nothing for himself, but wants daddy to get a job, or an abuela to get better, or a sibling to be safe overseas, or insert personal favorite here. This is because to the young at heart, Santa is the very image of faith, hope, and charity and that’s during the good times. For most, times they ain’t good. I’m Santa Ric Erwin, Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas (FORBS), the nation’s original Santa fraternity. We’re a 501(c)7 dedicated to the professional cause and we’ve successfully lobbied on behalf of the Christmas community to various state and federal agencies whenever significant issues have called for it. Today, I’d like to call your attention to one of our more successful efforts. The 2009 Christmas season was under serious threat by the H1N1 epidemic and with the vaccine approved but not yet publicly available, FORBS led the industry in petitioning for early access to the vaccine on behalf of America’s front-line seasonal workers. Our efforts were admittedly reliant on media support and public pressure. But you know what? It worked. Armed only with our letter to CDC, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID), I went to Kaiser on November 18th and received my H1N1 vaccination during or shortly after Tier 1 release and nearly a full month before Tier 3. Following my example, members in other parts of the country where able to do the same. Cumulatively, we were able to provide vaccinated Santas to nearly all major events and locations that year, not to mention the countless private parties that were saved. This year, Christmas will be more important to the American psyche than ever before. Our country is enduring an historic disaster trifecta and nearly all Americans endure unparalleled suffering, but we are still America and if past is prologue, families will do everything possible to end a bad year on a good note. Promising vaccines are in Phase 3 testing already and remaining social restrictions may be easing by Christmas. We’re asking that professional Santas and other frontline seasonal workers be granted early access to the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as practicable after Tier 1 release for the following reasons: 1) Traditionally, professional Santas place themselves in close personal contact with anywhere between 5 and 15,000 family members each holiday season; 2) Our target demographic, our clients if you will, are young children, notorious distribution vectors for all things infectious; 3) Most professional Santas are in the most at-risk category due to advanced age or underlying medical issues; and 4) Despite all of this, Americans are going to want Santa to be at Christmas 2020. I await your questions or comments. Thank you.",0,1,0,4,Promising vaccines are in Phase 3 testing already and remaining social restrictions may be easing by Christmas.

AUG,2020,Ms. Dorit Reiss,"Professor of Law,Hastings College of the Law,University of California","Well, even as a Jew, I realize that Santa is a hard act to follow, but I’ll try. I appreciate the committee’s careful work in overseeing and discussing COVID-19 vaccines. The presentations showed how much attention you put into safety and how many mechanisms are already in place, and more to be added. We really need this oversight. I also appreciate the transparency with which you present this to the public. We also need the transparency of seeing the oversight—of seeing what’s going on. It is critical that any decision about COVID-19 vaccines are made in the public eye just as you provide through this publicly available webcast today. This is just as important for the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and for licensing or recommending a vaccine, which is why I sincerely hope that the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) and FDA will review the data for the vaccine candidates and welcome public input before approving an EUA, and ACIP will have a strong role in the process as well. I also want to remind everyone that it is not only important to exercise oversight over the vaccine-making process, but it is important that the oversight be known. I think speaking to the public is intuitive to many of the scientists that do the heavy lifting in ACIP in the WG and committee, but the work to oversee that vaccine needs to be visible in order to create trust. This public meeting is great, but it is not enough. I hope that ACIP will make visible to the public their role in overseeing vaccines and the extensive work. For example, it would be useful to have fact sheets explaining your role in oversight generally—a fact sheet about the wonderful and many systems of monitoring that were presented here, and maybe a fact sheet highlighting the COVID-19 Work Group. We have a group of tons of independent experts, many with established careers, extensive experience, and no direct stake looking closely at the data, discussing it openly, and making sure it meets high standards. The public should know this. I hope you make an effort to bring this information to the pubic in multiple forms. Finally, as I said in my previous comment, I really hope ACIP considers adding a legal expert that has experience with equal protection to the Work Group. I am not an expert in equal protection, but I know enough to know that when you start considering race for allocation, you’re touching on issues that can have real legal pitfalls and a legal expert can help you avoid them?

AUG,2020,"C. Grace Whiting, JD","President and Chief Executive Officer , National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC)","Hi. Good afternoon. I’m Grace Whiting. I’m the President and CEO at the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC). I just want to thank all of you for the great work you’re doing and for giving us a chance just to speak, and say hello, and weigh-in. So the National Alliance for Caregiving is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. We’re based in the Washington, DC area and our mission is to build partnerships and research advocacy and innovation that can make life better for family caregivers. We just have two brief comments today to share. First is that family caregivers can be valuable partners in improving adult vaccination rates, and second that preventive care models should incentivize providers to include caregivers in shared decision-making. We know that there are roughly 53 million people in the United States, which is about 1 in 5 Americans who care for a friend or family member because of a healthcare need or functional disability. While we think about caring for another person as an intimate activity, in the aggregate it’s foundational to our health and social care systems. In fact, AARP estimates that the economic value of unpaid caregiving is roughly $470 billion dollars each year. That’s how much it would cost if we wanted to replace each caregiver with a paid worker as someone to help with activities of daily living such as grocery shopping, managing finances, high-touch activities like bathing and toileting, and medical nursing tasks such as wound care or colostomy care. Despite broad support from this committee and from other leaders in this space, adult vaccination remains low. We know from pediatrics that caregivers, when included in shared decision-making by formal care providers, can be critical partners and the same is true of adult partners in care. In the national research that we do with AARP, most caregivers who seek outside information prefer to talk to a doctor or healthcare professional. The next most trusted source is friends and family. Here, the Medicare program can provide some insight into how to incentivize shared decision-making between providers, patients, and family caregivers. Currently, the Medicare program can reimburse providers for family support related to transitional care, evaluation and management, chronic care management, education to a family member, patient monitoring, comprehensive clinical visits, a written care plan, the annual wellness visit, and advanced care planning. We would encourage this committee to consider models of care delivery that could likewise incentivize providers to have early, often, and open conversations with families about preventing infectious disease. Finally, as we heard this morning on COVID-19, the needs of older adults are front and center There’s an opportunity to meet the moment and recruit additional experts with expertise in adult and geriatric care.

AUG,2020,"Maria Gahry, DNP ","Nurse Practitioner, Private Practice","My name is Maria Gahry and I am a Doctor of Nursing Practice, Board Certified as a Family Nurse Practitioner. I speak on behalf of the patients I provide care for. We have a crisis of vaccine confidence and I fully understand why. I have personally cared for patients who have suffered a vaccine injury and have seen an increase in vaccine hesitancy and distrust over the last 6 months. My patients are questioning the safety of the new coronavirus vaccines. They know it’s being rushed to market with a lack of long-term safety studies. They are concerned there will be no liability or recourse for injuries they may sustain. They are concerned about the risk of autoimmunity, impairment, infertility, and the possibility of this causing cancer because of the nature of an mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccine. In some studies, safety will only be monitored for 1 month. It is unethical to monitor efficacy for 2 years, but not safety. All studies should be similar for safety monitoring. Inclusion criteria for the mRNA-1273 vaccine shows evidence that their concerns about these risks are completely rational. Female participants must have non-childbearing potential, not be pregnant at the start of the trial, and must abstain from all activities in which they could become pregnant for 28 days prior to the first dose and 3 months following the second dose at Day 29. Male participants engaging in activity that could result in pregnancy of sexual partners must agree to practice adequate contraception and refrain from sperm donation from the time of the first dose and through 3 months after the second dose. Given the specific inclusion criteria, what is the specific mechanism of this vaccine and are you concerned about it getting into the germline cells? After its approval, will this specific recommendation regarding fertility continue to apply to those receiving the vaccine? Clearly, those conducting the studies are fully aware of the risk it poses to fertility and the potential to affect DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). How can I instill confidence in my patients when we will have zero data about the impact of this vaccine on fertility and the long-term consequences the vaccine may have? Real-time monitoring will not pick up fertility or autoimmune conditions in VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). Mortality for COVID-19 is 0.26% for those infected and a small fraction of that for children. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine had an autoimmunity rate of 2.3% in the pre-license trials. If we translate that number to the US population and assume this new vaccine has a similar rate, that would equal 9 million new cases of autoimmunity. Can our healthcare system withstand this? Can you justify recommending a vaccine with a potential serious adverse event (SAE) rate that is significantly higher than the disease’s morbidity or mortality rate? And how can we, as medical providers, possibly instill confidence in our patients with these numbers? Patients are paying attention. My hope is you are too, as your recommendations will become mandates forced on all of us to participate in society.

AUG,2020,"Lindsay Clarke, JD","Vice President, Health Education and Advocacy, Alliance for Aging Research","Good afternoon. I’m Lindsay Clarke, Vice President of Health Education and Advocacy at the Alliance for Aging Research. For the past 4 years, the Alliance has led the “Our Best Shot” Campaign, which encourages older adults to play an influential role in their families and communities to debunk myths and make sure their own vaccinations are up-to-date. The CDC includes the campaign’s educational film on its website and we thank you for featuring this resource. We appreciate the important work that ACIP is doing; however, we urge you to make some changes to better respond to the needs of the older adult population, especially in the face of the double threat of COVID-19 and influenza outbreaks this fall. First, while the 2020- 2021 influenza season recommendations go into more detail on the evidence for enhanced influenza products, they continue to avoid recommending them over standard dose flu shots for people ages 65 and older. This is a clear missed opportunity to encourage older adults to seek out enhanced vaccines to protect themselves during one of the worst pandemics the US has ever experienced. Yes, any flu shot is better than no flu shot. But older adults are going to need all the protection they can get this year. Please take a stand on this. Second, we urge you to immediately add more experts in geriatrics and older adult vaccination research. Building better expertise on the ACIP and its working groups on how to care for older adults, including those with additional risk factors and those living in congregate settings, will be critical to assessing potential CPVOD-19 vaccines in the near-term and other promising adult vaccines in the future. Third, we believe that the committee’s current interpretation of conflict of interest (COI) for ACIP nominees is more restrictive than intended by the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and that this overly-strict interpretation may have dissuaded or even prevented experts in older adult vaccination from ACIP participation. We recommend that CDC develop clear and publicly available guidance on COI like the FDA has done. Please see our written comments for more on this. Lastly, we strongly urge ACIP to immediately eliminate economic considerations from its charter. We remind the committee that US federal civil rights laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibit the use of quality adjusted life years (QALY) and similar cost-effectiveness assessments in coverage and reimbursement decision-making in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The reason for this is that QALY assessments assign a discriminatory financial value to the patients for whom a given treatment is intended under QALYs, if a group is sicker, older, and/or disabled, their value is less. When applied to healthcare decision-making, the results can mean that some patients (people with disabilities, veterans, older adults) are deemed too expensive to receive care. Effectiveness should be measured by improvements to a patient’s condition and quality of life rather than personal characteristics or health status.

AUG,2020,Shoshona Fishbei ,"Communications & Marketing, Families Fighting Flu, Inc.","My name is Shoshona Fishbei and I represent Families Fighting Flu. Many people use personal stories to convey that vaccines are harmful or dangerous, but it’s also important to use personal stories to demonstrate why vaccines are crucial to preventing and potentially eradicating deadly and debilitating diseases. I use anecdotes to explain why vaccines are necessary both in my personal and professional lives. Personally, my sister had a febrile seizure after receiving a Tdap vaccine at age 13. It’s impossible to know if the vaccine was truly responsible for her seizure. But thankfully, this is an isolated event. We rely on science that shows that the benefits of vaccinating outweigh the risks, and this event has not stopped my family or myself from getting vaccinated. I know that sharing a story like this one allows people to begin to see the other side of the vaccine argument. That’s why I started working for Families Fighting Flu, a patient advocacy organization that highlights the stories of people who have died or suffered from influenza. These stories show that not vaccinating is not a risk-free choice. Foregoing an annual flu vaccine comes with the risk of some being hospitalized, having lasting complications, or even dying from influenza. Our stories include people like Allison Miller, a 33-year-old woman who survived a flu illness but was hospitalized for 3 months and suffered an amputation above the knee as a result of flu. We also share the story of Anakin Das who was a 10-week-old premature baby as a result of his mother contracting influenza while pregnant. He now suffers from chronic lung disease. We use these stories to encourage evidence-based practices like annual flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older. Storytelling is not just a method to be used by opponents of vaccines. Sharing stories of the benefits of vaccination allows us to help individuals understand the seriousness of influenza and the importance of annual flu vaccination. I implore you to share stories about the benefits of all vaccines to both individuals and communities and emphasize the risks of not getting vaccinated. We know that anecdotes are emotional, and emotions can motivate people to protect themselves and their loved ones against vaccine-preventable diseases. Thank you for your time.

AUG,2020,"Wexler Deborah, MD","Founder and Executive Director,Immunization Action Coalition (IAC)","Hi. My name is Dr. Deborah Wexler. I’m the Founder and Executive Director of the Immunization Action Coalition (IAC), a 30-year-old national nonprofit organization. Thank you for this opportunity to speak today. All of us are seriously concerned about the upcoming flu season and how we will be able to take care of our nation’s people with two different contagious diseases, influenza and COVID-19 circulating concurrently across our country. Your deliberations on COVID-19 vaccines will help lead the way to our ultimate control of that disease. But in the meantime, we must remember that we currently have the ability to provide and promote a critical public health intervention with readily available influenza vaccines. This fall, we must expand our influenza vaccination coverage to as many people as possible, reducing the likelihood of hospitalizations due to flu or, of even greater concern, hospitalizations resulting from dual infections with both influenza and COVID-19. Recently, IAC has learned of several colleges and universities that are putting influenza prevention into practice by making the policy decision to require flu vaccination for their students, faculty, and staff. On a larger scale, two university-wide systems, the University of Tennessee (UT) at its 4 campuses and the University of California and its 10 campuses, have implemented flu vaccination requirements. All of this is quite impressive, but the flu vaccination policy decision that took center stage just last week was from Massachusetts. For the upcoming season, the State of Massachusetts will require influenza vaccination not only at all the state’s colleges and universities, but also for all children and students who attended day care, childcare, and kindergarten through 12th
grade. These types of decisions are the direct result of ACIP leadership. Ten years ago, you made your age-based influenza vaccination recommendations to vaccinate everyone 6 months of age and older, which was an easy-to-understand guidance for providers to carry out. Thank you ACIP for making these straightforward recommendations. And thank you to the colleges, universities, and the State of Massachusetts that are leading the way by thoroughly following ACIP’s guidance. I hope many more will follow in their footsteps.

AUG,2020,"Nissa Shaffi, BS, MS","Associate Director of Health Policy , National Consumers League","Good afternoon. My name is Nissa Shaffi. I am here today on behalf of the National Consumers League (NCL). Since The League was founded in 1899, we have educated consumers about the vital role of vaccines in society and continue to dispel myths about vaccine safety. Today, we extend our gratitude to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for all that you do to protect public health and for the opportunity to speak here today. NCL strongly urges ACIP to increase and enhance infrastructure regarding vaccine confidence as the nation navigates the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has spread at an alarming velocity, and we need to ensure that we are utilizing our full reservoir of preventive services like vaccines. A small but vocal minority have politicized preventative health measures as perceived destructions and personal liberties. We need to ensure that vaccine hesitancy does not foil critical public health interventions, especially within the context of the pandemic. The American public should feel safe, informed, and empowered in their decisions to vaccinate once a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available. Due to COVID-19-imposed lockdowns, routine vaccinations across all age groups have declined by over 30% since 2019, with the largest decline observed among ages 19 to 49 at over 60%. Medically under-served communities and people with underlying health conditions are more vulnerable to adverse outcomes should they develop COVID-19. A decline in vaccination rates will further compromise herd immunity and endanger public health. Minority communities are among the hardest hit during this pandemic. Additionally, we request that clinical trials for the potential COVID-19 vaccines are inclusive and consist of diverse subjects to curb vaccine hesitancy regarding efficacy. The vaccine must be safe and effective and ample outreach must be conducted to ensure optimal herd immunity and vaccine confidence across all demographics. In closing, to stem the tide of deaths from these vaccine-preventable diseases, NCL urges the committee to maintain and encourage strong vaccine recommendations and infrastructure. This recommendation serves to ensure that we fortify health providers, public health leaders, and advocates with evidence-based medical options to help protect and advance the health of our nation during this pandemic and beyond.

AUG,2020,"Chari Cohen, DrPH, MPH ","Senior Vice President , Hepatitis B Foundation","Yes, thank you very much for this opportunity to speak today. My name is Dr. Chari Cohen. I am the Senior Vice President for the Hepatitis B Foundation, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to finding a cure and improving the quality of life for those with Hepatitis B. Today, we urge ACIP to consider a recommendation for universal adult Hepatitis B vaccination. Despite being one of the world’s leading causes of primary liver cancer, only 25% of adults in the country are fully protected against Hepatitis B. Most of the virus burden falls upon Asian American/Pacific Islander and African immigrant communities. When you add up the 17 separate groups recommended for either Hepatitis B testing or screening due to risk, including those who have diabetes and fatty liver disease, up to 84% of adults in the US are at risk and should be vaccinated. Recent projections show that several high-risk categories, including people living with diabetes and those with diagnosed sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are expected to continue rising over the next 20 years. With such a large proportion of adults meeting or expected to develop at least one risk factor, a universal HepB vaccine recommendation would improve the number of adults who are vaccinated and protected, preventing new infections in thousands of people. A universal adult Hepatitis B recommendation simplifies the vaccine process for providers, makes it easier for everyone to understand who needs to be vaccinated, and can eliminate a major barrier to vaccine uptake. Additionally, current guidelines are primarily focused on occupational exposures in healthcare settings. But increases in self-administered treatments and the opioid crisis have expanded occupational groups who may be at risk. Sanitation workers, cleaning service workers, and food service workers have all reported being accidentally stuck by a needle on the job. The CDC estimates that the average risk for contracting Hepatitis B from a needle stick is between 6% and 30% percent. While there are national and state protocols for safe needle disposal, an estimated 95% of needles are still discarded in municipal waste. Implementation of the Hepatitis B vaccine is currently limited by many logistical barriers. A universal adult vaccine recommendation is one large hurdle that we can jump to improve vaccine rates. We cannot eliminate HepB if we ignore key opportunities to protect our vulnerable populations. History shows that universal vaccine recommendations help increase vaccine rates and can open the doors for states to provide more aid. With increased awareness and support, we can reduce health disparities related to Hepatitis B and protect our communities. Thank you very much for your time.

AUG,2020,Mrs. Pam Raitt ,Concerned Individual ,"Thank you very much. I appreciate the opportunity. I will focus on the dangers of the coming fast track COVID-19 vaccines, pointing out the following facts. A healthy American has less than a 0.03% chance of dying from COVID-19. That is not a pandemic and is actually less than annual influenza season deaths. I recall Dr. Peter Hotez testifying in front of the Health Science Committee this March, “One of the things we’re not hearing a lot about is the unique potential safety problems of coronavirus vaccine. It was first found in the early 1960s with the RSV vaccines that some of these kids that got that vaccine actually did worse, and I believe there were two deaths as a consequence of that study.” This was actually a human trial cohort of 20 children performed in Washington, DC. Can we trust Moderna or Pfizer to develop a vaccine in only a short period of time that is safe and effective on SARS-CoV-2 when it hasn’t been done in the 18 years since the first outbreak of SARS? On March 15, 2020, HHS Secretary Alex Azar invoked the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act). This gave complete immunity to vaccine developers. Fast tracking has allowed vaccine development such as Moderna to bypass typical animal trials and go directly to Phase 1 human trials, bypassing a critical safety step. Despite hospitalizations in Phase 1 due to SAEs up to 20% in the high-dose group, they are moving ahead to Phase 2 and 3 trials and making 2 billion doses. In human trials, the vaccine is being giving to perfectly healthy individuals with exclusionary criteria like “could not be pregnant, overweight, never smoked, no family history of respiratory event problems, seizures, or any autoimmune diseases.” What is going to happen when we give this vaccine to the average American? We’re not only going to see 20% incidence of SAEs but likely much, much higher. And yet, with inadequate testing, we’re going to mandate the vaccine to be administered to the 18 million Americans with chronic diseases, including HIV/AIDS, autism, autoimmune diseases, cancer, neuroimmune diseases associated with animal viruses acquired from vaccines contaminated with animal viruses from birds, dogs, cows, pigs, monkeys, and aborted fetal tissue. When recipients of the flu vaccine and coronavirus vaccine are subsequently exposed to the wild coronavirus, this is when we will see the spike in SAEs. The flu vaccine has been around for 90 years and is ineffective. Each year, it causes far more injury than benefit as evidenced by Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) payouts, which are almost exclusively from flu vaccines in the past several years, including deaths in the elderly. Why would the coronavirus vaccine be different? Cochran has performed three huge systematic reviews on the flu vaccine in 2010, 14, and 17 and concluded that there is little evidence that flu vaccine prevents hospitalization or death. Given the above, moving forward and administering the coronavirus vaccines to the general population would constitute human experimentation and thus informed consent must be given by all Americans. In conclusion, these COVID-19 vaccines cannot be made mandatory to the general public, health care workers, military, or first responders. We the people will not consent. We have Constitutional and basic God-given rights to decide what’s injected into our bodies and those of our children.

AUG,2020,LeeAnn Ducat,CT Family Advocates ,"Thank you so much for having me. I’ll get right to it. Recent lawsuits have uncovered proof that the CDC, specifically this panel, recommended mandated vaccines to children that were never placebo safety tested. Without inert placebo testing, no one can point to any vaccine, even a COVID one, and say that it is more or less dangerous than the infection itself. My point is that we’re already at warp speed with these children’s vaccines and now we’re going even faster to approve a COVID one when we should be pumping the breaks. Rushing products to market in the name of greater good and using active placebos instead of inert ones is playing God. Dr. Fauci even told us that hydroxychloroquine couldn’t be given to dying COVID patients because of no placebo-controlled studies. By that logic why on earth would anyone recommend that healthy people receive a product that has not been held to the same standard? Is this really about public health or profitability? Because if you really cared about public health, why is this panel not recommending sunshine, exercise, organic food, vitamins, and adequate sleep? Because your current recommendations have created the sickest generation of kids ever. Ever. You have shut down the entire country and caused massive spikes in suicides, addiction, abuse, and hardship. Well, the day of reckoning is coming. The truth cannot be suppressed forever, even with censorship, no matter how much Ms. Dorit Reiss calls for it. Government health authorities are rapidly losing credibility due to blatant inconsistencies, half-truths, and lies. The false narrative about vaccine safety is crumbling. Even the CrossFit® guys sued you and won. They said, and I agree, “The CDC prioritizes industry partnerships over its charter to protect and inform the American public.” They also said that, “The CDC and HHS have simultaneously failed to address the chronic disease epidemic.” And they’re not alone. These complaints span from every racial and socioeconomic demographic. We want answers, we want accountability, and we want immediate change. The blunders made by the CDC surrounding vaccines in general and COVID-19 have recruited more activists at warp speed faster than I could have ever imagined. So, really, I’m here to thank you. You’re doing my job for me just by being yourselves—warp speeding the American public to justice for the lives we lost to Big Pharma. Your charade is almost over. There is honor in admitting when you’re wrong. It’s time to stand up for truth and it’s time to pick people over profits.

This is David Curry, President of the GE2P2 Global Foundation and head of its Center for Vaccine Ethics and Policy (CVEP). I am also Affiliate Faculty at the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University’s (NYU’s) School of Medicine. By way of disclosure, our foundation receives support from a range of individuals and organizations, including Pfizer and the Gates Foundation to support a free weekly digest reviewing peer-reviewed literature and global strategic developments in immunization and public health. Our comment focuses on a key element supporting responsibly and ethically sound deployment of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and others likely to follow very soon. This key element involves the information to be presented to recipients and caregivers as they are offered or seek vaccination. We argue that this information must be clear, must be appropriately written and presented for limited literacy and reading levels, be broadly translated for the diverse populations that will need to be vaccinated and otherwise present alternative vaccine options as they come available, and be otherwise supportive of recipients in making well-informed decisions to accept the vaccine. We recognize that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) does not require formal informed consent and that the information to be provided at a minimum is via the fact sheet for recipients and caregivers. In examining the EUA fact sheet now posted, we note that it is presented in text only with no graphical information to assist recipient comprehension, even though the fact sheet for providers does include graphical information; is presented at a reading levels does not appear to align with lower reading or literacy levels; and is limited to a document in English with no translations posted or any indication that translations will be posted. We are enthusiastic that Dr. Cohn, at the ACIP meeting December 1st, reported that additional supporting information was in development to enable informed consent for individuals offered vaccines in long-term care facilities (LTCF). The CDC toolkit now posted, apart from that focused to healthcare workers (HCW), appears to be generic and for all recipients. Apart from the limited depth of that content, these resources seem to be available only in English. We are concerned that, especially with the mention of assent today, the posted content will not be robust enough to effectively respond to the information needs of long-term care individuals and caregivers, or to the serious levels of vaccine hesitancy operative across many vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations. We urge, and energetically urge, and are confident that CDC will extend its best efforts to enhance these materials and we urge ACIP to continue to closely assess the supplementary information as it emerges to ensure that it adequately supports the intent of these recommendations.

DEC,2020,Barbara Loeppke,Loeppke Professional Service ,"Yes, my name is Barbara Loeppke and I speak on behalf of many concerned Americans like myself. The ACIP committee is the last gatekeeper protecting the American public. We all know that the President has pushed for fast-tracking these vaccines. We all know that the vaccine manufacturers are for-profit companies that stand to make hundreds of billions of dollars. We hope you remember that you have no duty to them. You have a duty to the American public, to each person. A duty to do no harm first. The public, who will rely on your recommendations for this fast-tracked vaccine will have heard the words and phrases I have heard while watching these meetings the last few months where it is like “should” and “probable” and “potentially.” Phrases like, “We don't know yet. We’ll know as the study progresses. We’ll know that in the future. We hope to have that answer soon. We estimate and we believe.” There are comments like, “We have no data on reverse transcriptase of the RNA into DNA. While it’s possible, we don’t think so.” Or to what if the vaccine doesn’t prevent transmission, “That’s correct. We have no data on that.” We know that the Pfizer Chairman, Albert Bourla, has even admitted that the company was not certain if vaccines prevented the coronavirus from being transmitted saying, “This is something that needs to be examined.” It is obvious that this vaccine has not been thoroughly tested yet. I have great concern, as do many, as I listened to the committee members find ways to try to explain away the concerns of the vaccine in areas such as pregnancy and anaphylactic reactions rather than turning to the manufacturers to make it safer. If you vote “Yes” will you inform the public that there are many questions that still have not been answered about this vaccine and that there are still questions about the long-term effects, or will you try to dismiss those in order to increase the vaccine uptake? In discussions about vaccine hesitancy by the committee, I never hear the committee admit that the CDC has a spotty history with minorities. The public has not forgotten the CDC’s Tuskegee experiment, the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) experiment on babies, or the years of sterilization procedures done on the incompetent. Don’t let this fast-tracked drug become another cautionary tale for the CDC. I hope you take this all seriously.

DEC,2020,Kermit Kubitz ,Individual ,"Thank you. Based on all the available evidence, including 90% reduction in cases between vaccinated and placebo recipients, antigen titers, and data on adverse events (AEs), the BNT162b2 vaccine appears safe, efficacious, and having a highly positive benefit-risk ratio for patients from 16 to over 75. It is appropriate to allocate the first doses to healthcare workers. According to Dr. Dooling’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) report of December 3rd, there have been 245,000 cases of COVID-19 and 858 COVID-related deaths among United States (US) health care personnel (HCP). The guidance for identifying injection effects and separating those from COVID-19 infections should also be available for long-term care facilities and staff where a high priority for the age group over 65, in which 70% of death has occurred, is necessary. I have a relative in assisted-living where there have been five coronavirus cases in staff and three among residents. Allocation of the vaccine should also be prioritized for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, which experience disproportionately high infection and mortality, including among persons aged 20 to 49. Their COVID mortality is around 8 to 10 times higher than among white persons according to Dr. Jessica Arrazola’s report of December 11th. The Moderna vaccine, which has a similar structure, mechanism of action, and coding messenger RNA for the coronavirus spike protein, and similar efficacy should also be approved quickly. There also need to be tools for telling the public and doctors about their place in priority allocation phases to avoid tying up doctors’ offices and phone lines with people seeking information about vaccine availability and their priority. In addition, the public health infrastructure should have multiple vaccines approved so that urban areas with ultra-cold storage can receive those vaccines and rural areas, which do not have access to the state’s regional logistical requirements, can obtain other vaccines. As we know, under an EUA, these are not approved until other vaccines are also available for EUA. Thank you to the ACIP, thank you to the FDA, and as someone said, “Let's get the logistical supply infrastructure out there.” Thank you.

DEC,2020,Peter Matz,"Director, Food & Health Policy,Food Marketing Institute","Good afternoon and what an exciting day it is. I think we can all see the light at the end of the tunnel after FDA’s authorization last night. My name is Peter Matz and I am here representing Food Marketing Institute (FMI) the food industry association, where I'm the Director of Food & Health Policy. First and foremost, thank you to the advisory committee for your leadership and tireless efforts to provide guidance, not just to the CDC, but to all of the states and jurisdictions modeling their plans after your recommendations. The importance of the COVID vaccines cannot be overstated and FMI greatly appreciates all of your hard work. By way of background, as the food industry association, FMI works with and on behalf of the entire industry from retailers who sell to consumers and producers who supply the food all the way to supermarket pharmacies to advance safer and more efficient consumer supply chains for both food and pharmaceuticals. In total, FMI member companies operate around 33,000 grocery stores and 12,000 pharmacies, ultimately touching the lives of more than 100 million US households per week and representing an industry with nearly 6 million employees. FMI appreciates this opportunity to share feedback. First, we strongly support ACIP’s recommendation to prioritize health care personnel in the initial phase of COVID vaccine allocation and we thank the committee for clarifying that this includes pharmacy workers. Supermarket pharmacies stand ready to be part of this historic vaccination effort and supermarkets are also prepared to offer sites for vaccine administration and support for outreach efforts on the importance of getting vaccinated while they continue providing nutrition, supplements, and pharmacy services in the interim. Having said that, FMI respectfully requests that food industry essential workers be prioritized for COVID vaccinations after that initial phase of vaccine allocations. Designated by the federal government as part of the nation’s critical infrastructure, the food industry has continued, bolstered, and at times shifted operations to ensure American families across the country have access to our products. Prioritizing COVID vaccinations for these workers would allow a key intervention to protect the food supply and keep supply chains operating. Therefore, we asked for a safe process to follow the examples set by the National Academy’s final framework for COVID vaccine allocation, which recommends prioritizing food industry essential workers behind healthcare workers and certain high-risk populations, and also to CDC’s updated COVID vaccination “Program Playbook” which suggests that states and jurisdictions consider including food industry workers in Phase 1b. Finally, we would also ask ACIP to consider prioritizing food industry workers with supporting a supply of personal hygiene, household, and commercial cleaning products. The latter is especially significant as consumers, retailers, and the food sector among others are being directed to use cleaning supplies, sanitizers, disinfectants, and other hygienic supplies to prevent the spread of COVID. So please do keep in mind the importance of those workers supplying critical personal and commercial cleaning supplies, as well as other essential consumer goods. FMI appreciates the opportunity to provide input on this critically important issue. Thank you.

DEC,2020,Julie Russell,Coronado Unified School District ,"Hello. Thank you committee for your hard work in providing the best for our country. As an elected representative of the Coronado Unified School District, I am speaking today to request that the critical decision-makers on your committee prioritize teachers, frontline school staff, and at-risk students in receiving the vaccination. Our teachers have provided distance learning instructions since the imposed school closures. In surveying our stakeholders, students, and parents, we have learned that instruction provided solely through distance learning platforms cannot fulfill the academic and social/emotional needs of all of our students. Despite our best efforts over the last 9 months, some students are not thriving. We acknowledge that there are still risks from the spread of COVID-19 and that until there is a widespread vaccine available for all, strong mitigating efforts must be maintained. Masks, social distancing, and sanitation efforts will be with us for at least the remainder of the school year. However, access to the vaccine for our staff would ensure that students can be with us in person. We ask that you recognize the importance of the safety of our staff and how many young lives each of them touch. We need our educators to be confident in returning safely to the classroom to resume the valuable and essential work of educating our students. This is especially important in the public sector where a strong union influences hesitation to return teachers back to the classroom. To provide an equitable opportunity for all American children, I will even go out on a limb and say this is a critical thing for our wider economy. It is important to get our kids back into the classrooms and the first step on this would be a prioritization of vaccinating staff. Thank you very much for this critical consideration and those are my comments.

I’m John Allen, Vice President for Regulatory Affairs & International Standards with the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA), which represents the nation’s dairy food manufacturing and marketing industry. However, I am here today representing a broader alliance of food, agriculture, and consumer goods industries associations to ask for your help and to express our thanks to CDC staff and members of the ACIP for your dedication to getting our country through these unprecedented times as quickly and as safely as possible. We fully agree that Phase 1b prioritization of the workforce is a needed defense measure to ensure that our essential workers are protected, remain healthy, and can continue ensuring the production and distribution of safe food and other necessary consumer goods to sustain the US population through the pandemic, but we need your help to make this happen. Please continue to recognize and prioritize access to COVID vaccines for frontline and other essential employees across our critical infrastructure sectors. Without your support for privatization, our supply chains could eventually fall apart creating widespread disruptions to our economy. As the country is on the cusp of initiating the COVID vaccination campaigns, yesterday we submitted written comments into the docket for this meeting laying out suggested guidelines for sub- prioritizing among essential workers within our sectors for vaccination. When necessary, particularly during Phases 1b and 1c when supplies are expected to be limited, we will be sharing these guidelines with state Governors and public health departments at all levels across the country. As vaccine allocation and needs at the local levels will vary inevitably from state to state and locality to locality, these guidelines will likely need to be tailored by local public health officials in coordination with companies within these sectors. To this end, we are encouraging our member companies across the country to reach out to their local health departments to begin discussing plans for vaccination of their employees immediately, including identification of those employees who should receive the first rounds of vaccinations. There is, indeed, very strong support among the public for government partnering with private sector to distribute vaccines to essential workers. I urge you to help us harness that support. To conclude, we offer help and support in working with CDC along with other state and local officials in any way we can before and after vaccines are launched, including help in communicating the benefits of vaccination to our essential employees. So, please don’t hesitate to contact us if you see any such opportunities for collaboration.

I am a co-author of the book “Your Baby’s Best Shot: Why Vaccines are Safe and Save Lives” and a community college Psychology Professor. I am here providing public comment as a private citizen and vaccine advocate. I would like to thank the committee for all of your hard work regarding the development of vaccines for COVID- 19, for your transparency throughout the process, and for your willingness to invite public comment. I would like to provide public comment on several issues regarding the COVID-19 vaccines: 1) Communities of color, particularly the African American community, have valid distrust of the medical establishment. Thoughtful work with national and local leaders of communities of color is vital to address these communities concerns in a way that honors their historical experiences. It is important to let these communities take the lead in figuring out what information would be most helpful to address their issues and to develop a system of allocation and distribution that is equitable across demographic groups to avoid exacerbating existing inequities; 2) People who are incarcerated and people experiencing homelessness should be prioritized, given that their situations make it difficult to adequately isolate or quarantine or to obtain masks or facilities for bathing. Incarceration or homelessness should not be a death sentence; 3) An educational infrastructure for the general public is needed to address concerns regarding the rapid nature of the development of these vaccines. The general public is not aware that the research and development process usually involves a great deal of unused time waiting for various approvals and funding sources, and that all of that wait time was eliminated during the process of prioritizing these vaccines. Providing this information to the general public may alleviate many of the concerns expressed regarding how quickly we have been able to get to this point. My co-author and I, in an article published in the journal Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics, proposed a multi-source model of education to address the concerns of people who are hesitant about vaccines. In such a model, everyone with whom a person comes in contact from public health departments, to Physicians, to nurses in vaccine clinics, to scheduling assistants is a source of accurate information regarding vaccines. In the body of research regarding vaccine education, and in my experience in combating vaccine misinformation, merely providing factual information is unlikely to alleviate concerns regarding vaccine safety and efficacy. Instead, medical and public health professionals would do better by soliciting information on people’s specific concerns and target information to those concerns. Since conspiracy theories are already being created regarding these vaccines, the rapid development of an educational program to provide accurate, transparent information is critical.

My name is Ann Lewandowski and I am representing the Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative (RWHD) and the Wisconsin Immunization Neighborhood (WIN). We would like to thank the committee and work group members for their hard work during this global pandemic when you have many demands on your time. We are deeply appreciative of the committee’s thoughts on rural healthcare personnel. We have been very worried about the feasibility of Pfizer’s vaccine with the ultra-cold chain and the large minimum order for rural members in Wisconsin. We would like to thank the committee for their thoughts in considering these logistical challenges during the discussion today. We asked the CDC not to ignore the challenges of the ultra-cold chain and large minimum order as the thermal shippers only serve one location. Subdivisions at the state level mean that the vaccine is distributed in a refrigerated state, which limits stability to 5 days. Our hospitals are busy with the surge, struggling with staffing challenges driven by exposures in the community and at work. Furthermore, our informational surveys highlight a workforce that is strongly vaccine-hesitant of these vaccines due to the lack of formal information and guidance until very recently. These challenges should not be underestimated. It has been reported that the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-term Care (LTC) partnership will receive thermal shippers of 125 doses. We hope the CDC considers how to ensure equitable access to this reduced minimum order size across locations that need it, including rural areas. We urge the CDC to release the clinical education materials as soon as possible. As previously mentioned, our hospitals and clinics are seeing a surge in COVID-19 cases and need time to allow the staff education required for the storage, handling, and administration of this vaccine. Our providers are anticipating swift delivery of this vaccine with a rapid move to administration. We urge the MMWR to include the thoughtful communications and recommendations for healthcare personnel who have allergic reactions, immunocompromising and autoimmune disorders, are pregnant and breastfeeding, and/or other special populations you discussed during your conversation today. We appreciate the committee’s thoughtful discussion and personally, I support the comment that autoimmune disorders specifically need to be addressed. I have an autoimmune disorder and I have heard similar comments about worry for a relapse. As somebody working on a prioritization with my state, I urge the committee to be clear and create consistent recommendations that can be easily applied at the state level, particularly as we move into additional phases, such as Phase 1b, that addresses essential workers.

I’m also representing and talking about those who work in correctional facilities, not only the officers, but also the food workers, handlers, those that take care of the maintenance, as well as the medical people. Definitions. There has been some confusion as to definitions of what is what. For example, congregate facilities. Does that in and of itself include jails, prisons, and juvenile facilities? In some of the state’s directives, it is not clear. Correctional facilities, clinics, and hospitals. What if a correction facility doesn’t have a clinic? Do they still include their inmates and patients to receive the vaccination? Correctional facility healthcare workers. Are they included in the initial Phase 1a of health care workers? Another factor, generally speaking, is we are concerned about individuals greater than 65 years old. Those incarcerated have an advanced age. Their bodies and generally 10 to 20 years greater than their counterparts on the outside. Therefore, should inmates 55 and greater be considered? Essential workers. There are a lot of essential workers in correctional facilities. Please do not leave them out. Children. Juvenile facilities include them. The state needs some direction. They are all over the place with their guidelines and plans. Some include correctional persons first. Some include them last. Inmates are at risk, a great risk, similar to that of nursing home persons. There is an increased number of minorities, black and brown, in incarcerated facilities. Please take that into consideration. Whereas the black community is 13% of the general population, in jails and prisons it is as great as 40%. Again, I thank you for all the work you’ve done.

I am a Professor of Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law and a member of the Vaccine Working Group on Ethics and Policy. I wanted to make 4 points. Let’s see if I can get through them. First, I’d like to thank the committee for its intensive transparent work since April following the vaccine development, asking hard questions, and openly providing extensive data on this. ACIP’s role in recommending vaccines is unique and critical to ensuring equitable access to safe and effective vaccines. ACIP has been transparently and openly working on this for years and we appreciate your efforts applying your expertise to this context as well. I also want to remind you that you’re not alone in combating misinformation about the vaccine. Actors like our friends at the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) and Vaccinate Your Family work hard to provide information to counter these, as do a large group of online defenses in blogs and comments. We will continue to respond to misinformation. Second, echoing the comments of the previous commenter, it is imperative to consider prisons as a vaccine priority site. In California, every single facility has a COVID outbreak. A third of the entire prison population has been infected with COVID and 96 people have died. That is in one state only. Prison authorities are not always quick in taking measures to allow social distancing and addressing the situation. COVID spikes in prisons correlate to spikes in the surrounding and neighboring counties. Requiring correctional officers to be vaccinated as a condition of employment is essential and the hard work of ensuring compliance must start now. Third, I appreciate that you recognize the need for clear guidance on the issue of severe allergic reactions and the need to update this moving forward as the evidence arises. I want to enforce the comments in the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meeting on this and the points made here and ask the committee to make it a priority to figure out which ingredient in the vaccine may cause a severe allergic reaction, because we need to know what is causing this fast, both for the safely and to respond to concerns of the public. I also hope you will support an urgent study of the safety of the vaccine in those that are known to be allergic to injectables and non-injectables and appreciate your proposed accommodation to such people to be closely observed after vaccination. Finally, although CDC and FDA previously said that you cannot mandate a vaccine under an EUA, I think that is not a good reflection of the law. The law is ambiguous and I hope that the committee will ask the FDA Commissioner to provide clear guidance in the EUA to direct actors on what they can and cannot do. Can they impose consequences for refusing a vaccine? Can they require people to wear more personal protective equipment (PPE) if they refuse? Can they require people to be reassigned? I think business will be looking for ways to encourage vaccines and they need guidance.

On December 1st, this committee recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be offered to both healthcare personnel and residents of long-term care facilities in the initial Phase 1a of the vaccination program. It was widely understood and communicated to the senior living industry by officials of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that residents of long-term care facilities included, in addition to skilled nursing facilities (SNF), the full continuum of senior living care, independent living, assisted living, memory care, and continuing care retirement communities. This was understood when the industry was encouraged to register for the CVS/Walgreens pharmacy program. As a result, operators of all settings registered their communities in anticipation of being treated as a prioritized population for access to the vaccine. However, we are now learning that while assisted living communities will be included among the initial vaccination groups, independent living settings will not be considered in the 1a group and it is unclear whether the independent living section of a building with multiple levels is included. We believe this to be incredibly short-sighted and are deeply troubled by this decision, given the resident population living in these communities and that their risk of contracting the virus is just as great as those living in nursing homes and assisted living communities. Residents of independent living are 82 years old on average and have higher rates of cognitive and functional impairments than those living in private residences. Additionally, many senior living communities offer multiple levels of care. To vaccinate the residents in assisted living but not in the independent living section of the same community would create confusion and emotional harm and is simply not efficient in the delivery of the vaccine to the most vulnerable. Our concerns extend to the staff of independent living communities as well. We believe all senior living workers, such as caregivers, dining staff, and others, including those who work in independent living are an integral part of the essential health care workforce and should not be overlooked in the federal plans for vaccine distribution. We ask that as the committee continues to review vaccine prioritization, consideration be given to recommend that all senior living settings, including independent living, be prioritized in the 1a category. Additionally, it is extremely difficult to serve our vulnerable seniors unless the staff in these communities are also vaccinated and free from COVID-19. Thank you.

DEC,2020,Katherine Falk,Parent & Vaccine Advocate ,"Hi, my name is Katherine Falk and I am a parent and vaccine advocate in Oakland, California. I want to thank the committee for all your hard work. I appreciate and very much share your concern about misinformation. I have been following and countering the spread of anti-vaccine misinformation online for years. There are broad categories of this misinformation, very often spread by people with, to be blunt, a financial interest in selling services or supplements. But, some of this is also passed along by people who are genuinely fearful, who have had a bad experience with the medical system, who don’t feel like they can trust mainstream sources. The last 4 years have been terribly corrosive to public trust. Most of all, it has become very clear that racism continues to be a destructive force in our country. I encourage the committee to address the problem of misinformation as much as possible, particularly as it impacts populations that have experienced historical trauma and continue to. Many of these conversations are going to have to take place within communities as opposed to outsiders lecturing. But if the leaders in these communities can be empowered with resources, that would be very helpful. I also hope that the guidance on how to allocate facts can include a conscious, deliberate effort to avoid reinforcing systemic racism and existing inequities. Thank you very much.",1,0,0,4,"Hi, my name is Katherine Falk and I am a parent and vaccine advocate in Oakland, California.","advocate, misinformation, racism",0,0,0,0,0,
DEC,2020,"Claire Hannan, MPH","Executive Director, Association of Immunization Managers","I’m Claire Hammond, Executive Director of the Association of Immunization Managers (AIM). Our nonprofit represents the state, territorial, and large urban area public health immunization programs. These amazing government employees have been working with CDC, Operation Warp Speed (OWS), state health officials, Governors, hospitals, and other stakeholders to plan for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine. Months of vaccine distribution and logistics planning are now coming to fruition. Guidance on subsequent priority groups is needed immediately. Jurisdictions are working now to plan for vaccine allocations coming in the next month. They need to work closely with providers and communicate clearly with consumers about what to expect. Many have advisory committees and ethics groups designed to assure equity and distribution. They cannot effectively plan and communicate expectations without guidance from the ACIP. There is tremendous pressure on Governors. I want to speak specifically to the dilemma facing jurisdictions with essential workers, those over 65, and those with underlying conditions. There is not consensus across states on how to vaccinate these groups. Some Governors have signaled the importance of vaccinating the most at-risk, the highest at-risk first for hospitalization and death (i.e., the older Americans), and those with multiple risk conditions. Yet, essential workers may be in harm’s way and can spread the virus in communities. The current definition of “essential workers” is extremely broad. For example, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) list for essential workers encompasses almost 60% of the population in North Dakota. These factors could lead to very different approaches across states. I urge the ACIP to provide specific guidance on prioritization as soon as possible. Guidance and educational materials are needed on exactly who should receive the vaccine, especially related to pregnant and lactating women, 16 to 17 year olds, and those with allergies. Screening questions that can be used by providers would be very helpful, so I’m very glad to hear about the CDC “What You Need to Know: Information for Vaccine Recipients.” I’d like to close by reminding the committee and everyone listening of the dire need for additional funding for state, territorial, and local public health agencies. Public health agencies have received just $340 million while more than $10 billion has been invested in vaccine research and production. Public health agencies desperately need funding to continue to enroll tens of thousands of providers, to hire community vaccinators and nurses, to purchase equipment and supplies, and to roll out large-scale communication plans with websites, educational materials, and hotlines. Nothing is more important to the success of this campaign than the trust of healthcare workers, nursing home residents, and eventually all Americans in every community in the safety and effectiveness of this vaccine. Resources are needed. Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comment on this truly historic day.

DEC,2020,Gina Harrison ,Concerned Parent ,"My name is Gina Garrett Harrison. My son is permanently handicapped and medically exempt because of your negligent recommendations. I’m having some issues with the conflicts of interest (COIs) that your panel is saying they do not pose, which I would like to ask you how is it more of a conflict of interest of having an entire panel of pro-vaccine people recommending vaccines to the entire United States? Where are all the opposing voting members who are also scientists and virologists? And since vaccination is for the public, shouldn’t your panel be equally diverse with each side being well-represented? We’re not only dealing with the pandemic, but we’re also dealing with an epidemic of the public’s mistrust in your recommendations. In order for something to be considered science, I believe the public needs to have confidence in you. During your 2020 ACIP meeting in February, you had stated that you didn’t even know what the term “healthy” meant because it had never been defined. This is a huge problem. In order for something to be rubber-stamped, the public needs to be told exactly how all of these studies are set up. What type of placebo is being used and which form of placebo is being used? We are hoping that you know this information. Do you? Is the placebo another vaccine? Is it the vaccine’s adjuvant? Is it the lipids that are questionable at best? The public also needs to know the exclusion criteria from the study and how these test subjects were screened to the fullest. They were physically, mentally, and lab-confirmed to be the healthiest participant receiving this vaccine. It’s interesting because one of the things that completely disqualified you as a participant was having a history of vaccine reactions, such as anaphylaxis or any reaction to any of the components in the study intervention. Something tells me that when somebody checked that box, they finally listened and I bet they were shooed off really quick. The public also needs to know that this vaccine has not been proven to prevent transmission. You’re recommending all these healthcare employees to take this vaccine that may not even protect them against the infection. They’ll take it thinking that they’re safe only to have their symptoms reduced just like whooping cough and they become super spreaders without even knowing it. The public also needs to know that the 1976 national swine flu epidemic that spawned a very strong vaccination push also generated numerous lawsuits due to the number of deaths that were caused. This is a repeat. It’s history repeating itself. We are so tired of you walking through your job with blinders.

DEC,2020,"Tom Rosenberg, MBA","President & Chief Executive Officer, American Camp Association","Thank you, Dr. Romero. I am Tom Rosenberg, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the American Camp Association (ACA). I appreciate the opportunity to address the CDC/ACIP committee on behalf of the ACA and 47 other national Out of School Time (OST) youth educational organizations. We have submitted written comments to the committee to ensure that all categories of essential childcare workers in all OST settings are prioritized for early allocation of COVID-19 vaccines within the education sector. This position is in accord with the criteria set forth in the guidance provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Workers supporting the education of our children and adult learners in a myriad of settings qualify as essential critical infrastructure workers as defined by the US Department of Homeland Security. The ongoing availability of healthy staff and continuous operation of these valuable Out of School Time programs is critical to the economic recovery of our country. Workers operating in OST settings, such as organized camps, after school programs, childcare, community-based centers, and recreation programs provide essential services to early learners and students and to their working parents and caregivers. Hundreds of camps are engaged with their local school districts and municipalities in a variety of ways now as Alternative Learning Centers (ALC). Most of these out-of-school programs provide in-person, early, and K through 12 learning support and enrichment, while others facilitate safe and supervised care for children who are participating in distance learning in partnership with families, local municipalities, and school departments. Our workforce has enabled healthcare and frontline workers to attend to their essential duties with the confidence in knowing that their children, infants to teenagers, are being supervised, well taken care of, and benefiting from in-person education. These workers have carried out these duties despite the loss of substantial revenue due to COVID-19 impacts on the economy. As we move ahead into Spring and Summer, many more community centers, after school programs, recreational areas, and organized camps are planning to open and hire staff to provide continuing service and care to our children, young adults, working parents, and caregivers. We, therefore, urge you to include these workers in the CDC/ACIP vaccine allocation and distribution recommendations for the education sector to be eligible for Phase 1b access to COVID-19 vaccinations when available. I sincerely appreciate this opportunity to present to the committee and look forward to working with the CDC as a valuable partner, as well as others, in the implementation and rollout of vaccines to these workers.

FEB,2020,Lynette Barron ,Barron 10 Acre Farm ,"Hello ACIP. Thank you for letting us come back, and allowing the public to be a part of these meetings. I always like to thank you for that, because we definitely like to be able to come in, and listen to all of this, and kind of see what’s going on, and what’s being added, and what’s being voted on. One of the things that I kind of wanted to talk about, and I probably won’t even need 3 minutes, is just some of the things you guys do recommend on your website. You can go to cdc.gov and you can look up the recommendations for your child’s first baby foods. You are to introduce 1 food at a time [with] 3 to 5 days in between these baby foods. It could be apples, bananas, whatever. You are told to look for severe allergic reactions. You’re told what to avoid. You’re told if your family has a history of reactions to these type of foods to be sure you’re looking out for it, or to avoid them all together. You’re told so many different things. You’re told not to ever give 2 types of food in one day, because there could be a reaction and you’re not sure which food did that. But then you go to cdc.gov, the same website, and you look at the vaccine schedule. Same age range, 4 to 6 months. They’re getting 6 to 8 vaccines in a day. You have a reaction, not only do they not believe you’ve had a reaction, but they also have no clue which vaccine it was because they’re giving you so many in one sitting. I can’t understand how we are, as parents, told from the same website to spread out our apples and bananas 3 to 5 days in between them, but it’s okay to give all these vaccines with all these different antigens, and adjuvants, and neurotoxins, and all these things—we all can go to your website and see what are in them—and give them that many in one sitting. I can’t wrap my head around that and I don’t understand how any of you who make these recommendations could see that apples could be possibly more dangerous combined with bananas than formaldehyde and aluminum or any of these other things. How can you recommend to spread out your baby food 3 to 5 days in between, but not your vaccinations? I mean, this is the most confusing recommendations. I hear you guys have an hour’s worth of word play on the word “recommend” before. “How do we say recommended without saying recommended?” You’re recommending that we spread out baby foods, but you’re not recommending that they spread out vaccinations with all these ingredients in them? To me, that’s just the most insane thought. You’re all doctors. Y’all don’t think that’s insane? That is the most mind-blowing thing to me that I’m supposed to separate my apples and bananas for a reaction so I’ll know if it was the apples and bananas, but I’m not supposed to spread out all this stuff? How much sense does that make? I mean, that’s my question for you today. I’d like to ask all the people who came here who I’ve invited, please be respectful during this entire public time. Thank you guys. ",1,0,0,2,"They’re getting 6 to 8 vaccines in a day.

FEB,2020,Laura Ciminelli ,Concerned Citizen ,"Hello. Vaccinate with Confidence, the strategic framework to strengthen public trust—it’s a fail. The gladiatorial claim that only CDC, ACIP, WHO, and their affiliates alone have expertise is outrageous. This dismisses the equally educated scientists and doctors who question the current vaccine schedule. Parents who reject or dare to question the schedule are slandered as misinformed, a public global health threat, or discredited as anti-vax. We blindly followed your vaccine schedule. We read the one-page Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) until our children succumb to the adverse reaction not listed on it. Your vaccine statement does not equate informed consent, which means informed of all risks and benefits on the pharmaceutical insert like seizures, ADEM (Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis), SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome), encephalopathy, and the flu gives flu-like symptoms. We’re never told about those. I hear your boast—the science is settled and the vaccines are safe and effective, except they’re not. Fully vaccinated communities have outbreaks of mumps and whooping cough often. Your flu shot efficacy never hits the mark. Yet, now you say get two. One doesn’t work, so get two. What kind of science is that? Your science is gravely outdated. Autism statistics, 1 in 59. Data collected 2014. You might want to check your calendars. Instead of worrying about global health threats, look at the autism. Right? I tell you, my grandson’s school had one self-contained autism class, which now there’s four. But, your data is 2014. It’s not like it’s not a national crisis. It’s not like vaccines don’t contribute. Dr. Shannon Kroner orchestrated an esteemed panel of scientists and MDs in Atlanta in 2018, “One Conversation”—one of those esteemed doctors is in your audience—to be a debate on the risk and benefits of your schedule. Last minute, the proponents failed. Are you that confident that vaccines are beneficial, safe and effective, with low risk? Why is open discussion refused and denied? This increases my lack of trust. I watch nationally as legislators push your schedule along with the media ramrodding over our freedom of religion rights to say “no” to your vaccine schedule. Defining my God by the constraints of a denominational box—this is not how the framers penned it in the Constitution.

FEB,2020,Lauren Colon ,Concerned Citizen ,"Good afternoon. I have attended a number of these meetings, both in person and watching live online, and I have witnessed countless parents standing here pleading for you to listen to their stories of their children who were injured or killed by the products you arbitrarily recommended here. I have watched in agony as members of this committee have played on their phones and held conversations during these parents’ heartfelt pleas for your recognition and consideration. That is why I am not here to talk about my own son’s vaccine injury. I use the term “arbitrary” to describe your recommendations because I have reviewed your GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) table provided for your consideration of each vaccine presented and notice a section on “Risk Versus Benefit.” If you were truly considering the risk/benefit factors, you wouldn’t be able to recommend many of the vaccines that you add to the schedule each meeting because the numbers do not hold up to this assessment. For example, in June of 2019, Prevnar 13 was reviewed for further recommendation and it was discussed that over 28,000 individuals needed to be vaccinated to prevent 1 case. Now consider that the population of the US (United States) ages 65 and above is roughly 49 million. If all 49 million of those individuals are vaccinated, the vaccine would only prevent roughly 1750 cases of the disease each year. Now consider the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) reports for Prevnar 13 in just 2018. For that same population, it’s 2470. I am not a math genius, but even children can see that the adverse reports are higher than the potential number of cases prevented. It’s no secret that Harvard found that less than 1% of adverse events (AEs) are reported, and we know that not everyone will be vaccinated. So, the numbers are even further skewed in the risk over benefit factor, which makes your recommendation for continued use nothing more than arbitrary. Next, consider the meningococcal B vaccine being mandated in several states for entry into college. The incidence of the virus in the US has been on a rapid decline despite the minimal uptake of use of the vaccine in college age groups, with consideration that this committee acknowledges the waning efficacy after two years, rendering childhood vaccinations ineffective. In 2018 alone, there were only 330 reports of the virus in the US. But in the same year, there were 978 adverse reported events for the men-B vaccine. Again, risk versus benefit does not add up to support the recommendation of this vaccine. The numbers are similar for several of the vaccines on the current schedule, but my time up here prevents me from continuing. So, I will leave you with this. I have watched as countless attendees have begged you to study the science further, but since you seem to find science to be a matter of opinion, I’m going to ask you to do the math, because numbers don’t lie.",1,0,0,1,"If you were truly considering the risk/benefit factors, you wouldn’t be able to recommend many of the vaccines that you add to the schedule each meeting because the numbers do not hold up to this assessment.","injury, arbitrary, risk, adverse",1,"But in the same year, there were 978 adverse reported events for the men-B vaccine",men-B,0,"If all 49 million of those individuals are vaccinated, the vaccine would only prevent roughly 1750 cases of the disease each year",
FEB,2020,Karen Ernst,"Director, Voices for Vaccines (VFV) ","Hi. Thank you. My name is Karen Ernst. I am Director of Voices for Vaccines (VFV). I’m here today because of many reasons, but primarily because it’s all together possible that the chickenpox vaccine saved my child’s life. He was 10 days old when his older brother was exposed to chickenpox in his classroom. His older brother, of course, was vaccinated. Chickenpox didn’t come home to us. The possibly catastrophic effects of chickenpox on a 10- day old baby is something we never experienced. So, it’s possible that the chickenpox vaccine saved his life, but we don’t know that. I don’t know if the measles vaccine saved my life. My mother doesn’t know if the polio vaccine saved her life. My grandmother doesn’t know if the diphtheria vaccine saved her life. My great grandparents will have no idea if the smallpox vaccine save their lives. In fact, when you go about your business, you have no idea whose lives you’re saving. You can’t go into the world and say, “There’s a child who would have succumbed to measles were it not for the work that I do at ACIP.” When you go forth, you spend a lot of time doing that work. I think all of the discussion about the Ebola vaccine that we had this morning really shows us truly how much work goes into ACIP recommendations. The months, and months, and months, and I heard sometimes all-nighters that go into workgroups; the years of research and data collection that happens all over the world—all of this comes together. We know that in 20 years of giving vaccines that those vaccines have saved approximately 732,000 lives in the United States and 21 million hospitalizations. We just don’t know who those kids are, and so we can’t come here and tell their stories. But, I want to assure you that the work that you do when you’re looking at saving lives, and building those numbers, and really making sure that we have soccer teams full of kids, we’ve got classrooms full of kids, we have families full of kids—that those things continue to occur because of the recommendations that we’re making for immunizing our children on time. I’m grateful for those recommendations, I’m really grateful I vaccinated my kid against chickenpox, and I’m very grateful that my children are completely up-to-date on vaccines and that nothing’s happened. That’s really the story of your success—we get vaccinated and nothing happens. I will just make a plea that when you’re doing all that work as workgroups, you sort of let us know how much time was put into this, because I think that makes a big difference.

FEB,2020,Marcy Flickinger,Concerned Citizen and Mother ,"Hello and thank you for allowing me to speak to all of you again. My status of being a concerned citizen and mother to three children from Pennsylvania has not changed, but how I have chosen to address all of you most certainly has. I do not want to be labeled an “anti-vaxxer” nor a “troublemaker.” Rather, I’d like to be seen as a “change maker” and for you to be known as the “solution creators.” But in order to facilitate change, we must face the hard facts. According to the CDC’s website, infant mortality rates in the United States are consistently higher than equally well-developed countries. We can all agree that infant mortality rates gauge how healthy we are as a society. I cannot help but to ask why are we so behind? One would think that with all the vaccine hesitancy, the top three reasons for infant deaths in America would be measles, mumps, or maybe even pertussis. Instead, it’s congenital abnormality, premature birth, and SIDS. On one hand, the CDC’s website boasts about how SIDS rates have drastically decreased since the “Back to Sleep” campaign and yet if you continue reading, they eventually mentioned how undetermined and accidental suffocation rates at the same time have equally risen. This perplexed me so naturally, I did some digging and I found that the ICD (International Classification of Disease) codes have been reclassified from “SIDS” to “undetermined,” “accidental,” etcetera. Isn’t the collected data how we monitor vaccine safety? Maybe this could be attributing to the fact that we still don’t know what causes SIDS. Speaking of data, according to the VAERS database, there have been over 8,000 deaths reported after recent vaccination. Almost half of those deaths were children under the age of 6; 3600 were under the age of 1; 789 of those under 1 died the day after their shots; 2273 deaths occurred within 7 days of their vaccinations. Dr. Gregory Poland, Vaccinologist, Professor of Medicine at the Mayo Clinic and Director of Research of the Mayo Clinic states that, “Vaccine development has followed the one- size-fits-all approach. Unfortunately, we are reaching diminishing returns.” More funding needs to be allocated towards his genetic research in the individualized vaccinology. Precision medicine is the new frontier. Why aren’t we using these same methods when it comes to vaccines? We can all attest to the fact that there’s a subset of non-responders walking around thinking they’re immune and equally beside them are the adverse reactors who are now ex- vaxxers. Why not address this now using the same advances in genetic discoveries? Just like way back when taking mercury out of the vaccines just to appease us mothers, can you do the same by start building a genetic database starting with these dying babies? I’m no doctor nor a scientist, but I say it’s time we catch up to modern medicine and start compiling the genetic data so you can finally create a solution to these very serious events.

FEB,2020,Erika Geuser,Health Freedom Georgia ,"Hello. Good afternoon, beautiful people. Thank you for your time. I’m so excited to be here. This is not my first time speaking. I really wanted to speak a lot from the heart, so a lot of this was kind of written on the fly today. I like to think we’re all here for the same reasons, right, for the health of our nation, our children, and future generations. It’s hard to believe there could be people like me, right, that don’t support a life-saving product. It just doesn’t make any sense does it, logically? I’m a person of logic—someone that takes a vacation day from work to sit in rush-hour traffic to attend a meeting like this. That’s me. In fact, some travel much farther than myself and they spend a lot of hard-earned money, okay, to attend. Many that are here in support of vaccines, on the flip side, are paid to be here as a part of their job. They get their travel expensed and they have some financial ties or incentive to these products. This is one of the most important synchronicities I hope you guys will ponder on logically. This is not a coincidence. I simply don’t believe in coincidences anymore—only winks from God or cause- and-effect situations. Don’t get me wrong. I’m working, too. But I’m a servant of God, okay, through serving the people. I attend these meetings representing the sweet angel babies and am honored to be a voice for the voiceless. These victims are listed on my dress here. I wear this dress every time I come. It represents America, freedom, patriotism, our human rights, and justice and truth. And these families and these sweet angel babies deserve justice for the loss of life and tragedy that your recommendations can create and do create. The repeated mantra of “vaccines are safe and effective” must stop. There’s something very important missing from what you do here in assessing risk versus benefit—the presence of God, the universe, and natural law. How can you honestly determine effectiveness and risks when there is no way to determine who would even get the virus or disease? That is, if they’re even going to be exposed to it. We’re really playing a lot of God here guys. How about a focus on controlling and understanding the chronic illnesses and mystery deaths happening? We have so much technology and resources, but we can’t understand or find a reason behind why healthy babies are dying. SIDS, autism, autoimmune issues, gastrointestinal issues, mental health issues, the list of mysterious health ailments. They go on and on. They’ve affected me personally in my family. Meanwhile, you have an avalanche of citizens coming forward saying they noticed a correlation of these issues happening after shots and their cries are being met with hatred, division, and government mandates instead of sound investigation. Many doctors are in denial about adverse events, and the reporting system is broken per the Harvard Pilgrim study. You can look it up. Done by the HHS (Health and Human Services). It’s showing that less than 1% of adverse events are even reported into the system. We have multiple vaccine injuries in my family, and they have yet to be reported. My Graham got IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) after the rabies shot. My son and I both had serious adverse events to Hep B. My mom [got] transverse myelitis after the flu shot. This has to stop guys. Stop calling it “rare.” Stop saying this doesn’t happen The system is broken. We must fix it and we ask for your help with this. I know that you’re all here for the right reasons. Please join me.

Only then will you find that the science isn’t settled and the one-size-fits-all model is flawed. We need to be aware that when we get vaccines we are consenting to be part of the post-market data. Parents deserve to know the risks. Fifty-four percent of children in America are now diagnosed with a chronic illness—an illness that’s dependent on a pharmaceutical product. How convenient for their pockets. This is the pandemic you should be non-stop finding answers for. By 2025, the cost of autism alone will be more than over a trillion dollars. More than the defense budget. I urge you to truly research this even if you lose your funding and donations, parents deserve to know. If you choose not to, I hope and pray that you sleep well at night and that your retirement plans are worth it. The families affected by this growing statistic do not have that luxury.

FEB,2020,"KJ Moore, RN ","Traveling Nurse, Carpe Diem Nursing ","Hi. KJ Moore. Third time’s the charm. Carpe Diem Nursing. Traveling Nurse. Vaccinations are the leading cause of coincidences worldwide. Correlation doesn’t equal causation, until it does. Science so settled it has a market worth $58.4 billion by 2024, and its flaws deliberately covered up. Science so settled, but we still don’t know what causes autism. Vaccines so safe, the National Institute of Health study from 1994 titled “Death” reveals that the Vaccine Safety Committee was charged with assessing a causal relationship between all of the vaccines it reviewed and deaths reported to the VAERS vaccine reporting system. To answer the question, “Can any deaths be attributed to the use of vaccines discussed in this review?” the fluoride is Working. You don’t remember the study? It even mentions the Cutter Incident, a well-known example of vaccine contamination caused by errors in quality control by the manufacturer and lack of clear guidelines where several people died. Ask me about that. In another case in 1991, several deaths were reported following administration of measles vax in India. Look at Somalia last year. Very same thing. No cases of measles until they started vaccinating and then boom, everyone started dying. We have science so settled, babies died from SIDS or VIDS, vaccine induced, always 24 to 48 hours after their pediatrician vaccinated them. How come it’s never 24 to 48 hours before they went to their doctor? Correlation doesn’t equal causation, until it does. Science so settled, measles and mumps went from being a rite of passage that gave you immunity to certain cancers—I guarantee you more than 50% of this room and their parents and their grandparents survived measles. How’d you get here? But now my children can’t opt out of a live virus that the study says could cause systemic infection that could be fatal. That’s from your study National Institute of Health. I can send you the link. Vaccines so safe the adverse effects are death! Death! Vaccines so safe glyphosate, a cancer-causing ingredient also known as Roundup, has been found contaminated in all vaccines. Vaccines so effective that entire schools and military ships are quarantined with measles or mumps or whooping cough. Every single person is vaccinated. Vaccinated! The vaccine epidemic has gotten out of hand. It’s time we stop ignoring the real science. It’s right there on Google, but you guys are censoring it because you don’t want the truth getting out, because of your billion dollar market.

FEB,2020,Dr. James Neuenschwander,American Association of Physician Specialists (AAPS) ,"Once again, it’s Dr. James Neuenschwander. I’m a physician dually board-certified in emergency room (ER) and integrated medicine, with over 30 years of experience caring for chronically ill children and adults. I have personally witnessed vaccine injuries in my career as an emergency room physician, and I can tell you it is not rare and certainly more than 1 in a million. I’ve also heard hundreds and thousands of stories from parents and patients who will swear that it was vaccines that caused their children’s autism, autoimmunity, asthma, or other chronic illness. I’m here today to tell you you’re losing the confidence of those people and the health care practitioners (HCP) that care for them when it comes to vaccine safety. I stood here in October and challenged this committee, the CDC, the NIH (National Institutes of Health), and anybody that would listen to a public debate on vaccine safety. I can tell you my phone has not been ringing off the hook, so there’s certainly a need for far greater vaccine safety research. Without that science, we can’t have good communication. We can’t repurpose the same old science because it’s gonna make things look better. “We need more investment in vaccine safety science.” Those are not my words. Those are the words of Heidi Larson, who is the Director of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Vaccine Confidence Project™️ (VCP™️). In 2013, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) was tasked with the job of determining the safety of the entire vaccine schedule. What they found was there wasn’t any evidence. There was no study comparing the health outcomes of a vaccinated population to a completely unvaccinated population. In response, the CDC created a committee of experts to determine how could you ethnically do this study using current databases like the Vaccine Safety Datalink, the VSD. The result was a 2015 white paper in which they outlined the 20 most concerning health conditions, along with details on how to do each of these studies. They even gave a specific example of how to use the VSD to study how the schedule affected a child’s risk of asthma. That was 5 years ago. Nothing has happened. We’re all still waiting. Do the study. If you want the statement “vaccines are safe and effective” to be anything more than an advertising campaign, you need this kind of science. If you’re unwilling or unable to do this, please step aside and give people like me access to the VSD. We’ll make sure those studies are done. My God. Dr. Larson also pointed out that the vaccine-hesitant are winning people to their side at a much greater rate than the vaccine-confident. They’re 5 times more likely to go to the other side. You’re losing that battle. She also pointed out that there’s a wobbly frontline of health professionals that are questioning vaccine and vaccine safety. She said this is a huge problem. A huge problem that you can do something about. You guys have the power. I’d like to remind you of the first ACIP committee meeting in 1964. Part of that committee meeting challenged this committee to responsibly advise for new projects and research. I think it’s time to step into that responsibility. Please. Do the studies.

FEB,2020,Tiendra Severino ,Concerned Citizen ,"Hi. Tia Severino. Luke’s mom. In February 2018, I watched this panel unanimously approve the new HEPLASAV-B® vaccine for hepatitis B. This vaccine contains a new adjuvant that has not been tested with other vaccines. It is completely unknown how it will interact with adjuvants currently being used. Questions were asked about this and your Secretary stated that, “Generally speaking, vaccines can be given at the same time as other vaccines, but should be given in a different limb.” Giving vaccines in different limbs does nothing to stop them from mixing in the body. This is common sense. Yet, this ridiculous notion was accepted by this panel. Everyone voted “yes.” After voting, one of you did express concerns about the heart attacks in the trials and asked when information would be available from the public data surveillance system. The answer? “It will require people to be using the vaccine.” Hmm. This vaccine was rejected twice by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). But now that you approved it for market, our children, the public, get to be experimented on. I have a problem with that! You should have a problem with that! Patients must be told about all potential risks with medical procedures, but for three years, the public has not been told that they’re part of a test group. Here’s an example. I have a friend named Isaac Lindenberger. He said I could talk about his experience. After his younger brother Ethan’s story became a national conversation, Isaac decided to get his vaccines for college. He went to the health department. They gave him 6 vaccines, 3 in each arm. One of them was your new HEPLASAV-B® vaccine. Hmm. Isaac was not told that this was a brand-new vaccine that came with a heart attack risk—that it had never been tested with other vaccines. He has no way of knowing what the long-term risks are for him. You know your suggestion to give it in another limb? Even that wasn’t done. He gave it in the same arm with 2 other vaccines. So, like it or not, Isaac’s part of your test group. Will he develop heart disease or autoimmune issues from this experimental vaccine? If he does, who is going to be held accountable? Nobody’s liable. They make them, you approve them, and then you wipe your hands clean! But guess what? We’re awake. We’re watching you. Your efforts to censor us, all your propaganda and your labels—they’re failing. People are waking up and we’re not going away. Thank you.

FEB,2020,Sandy Spaetti ,Concerned Citizen ,"I’d like to begin by quoting Colossians Chapter 3 Verse 23, “Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord, not for human masters.” Ponder that. Ask yourselves, “Who am I serving? Am I truly serving the needs of the public and working for the greater good? Am I doing all that I can to ensure safe and effective vaccines for everyone? Am I serving God and doing what is right in his eyes, or has the pharmaceutical industry become my master?” Listen y’all, I had a very eye-opening dinner with Dr. Paul Offit this past October. I questioned Paul about the Hep B shot for newborns. He said, and I quote, “Babies need the Hep B shot because, for instance, mom brings baby home from the hospital and Uncle Joe comes to visit and sneezes on the baby.” I kid you not. That’s what he said. I was absolutely shocked. After a few seconds, I recovered and said, “Wait a minute Paul. Hold up. Does Uncle Joe have a nosebleed?” He changed the subject. Does Paul truly believe Hep B is transmitted via sneezing? Doubtful. A quick search on the CDC website verifies that it’s not. Or does he realize that there is no legitimate reason to vaccinate all babies for Hep B, so he just rattled off some crap. This exchange is just one illustration of why we no longer trust our doctors. Also, we don’t trust you, the ACIP members, to make wise recommendations for the vaccine schedule. Honestly, the schedule needs to be scrapped. You can start by removing that Hep B vaccine. That’s a change we could all get behind. We are fed up. We are sick and tired of you all smugly ignoring every testimony that comes before you. How can you sit here and listen to anguished parents telling you about their babies who have died and their injured children and continue to vote “yes” on every new recommendation? How do you sleep at night? You are perpetrating crimes against humanity truly. You don’t care about the wide varied genetics of these babies. You treat them like cookies going down an assembly line, all being punched with the same cookie cutter. You know that medicine is not and cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach. Yet, when it comes to vaccines, you lose all rational thought. What in the heck are you doing? Hear me loud, hear me clear. Your gig is up. The public is no longer deceived. You’ve lost our trust and all credibility. Think long and hard about what you’re doing and ask God to open your eyes and heart to the real truth about vaccines. Face the facts. Vaccines are harming children at an alarming rate. Give up that old tired sales pitch that “vaccines are safe and effective.” Quit denying the injuries and deaths. Stop saying adverse events are one in a million. Listen to the mothers, fathers, and grandparents who are screaming at the top of our lungs, “Vaccines harmed or killed my child!” I don’t think too many of you are concerned with serving God. I think you are primarily concerned about money. All you ever do is add to the schedule, add to the schedule, add to the schedule to make more money. I challenge you today. Prove me wrong.

FEB,2020,Savannah Starkey ,Concerned Citizen ,"I want to thank you for opportunity to come here today first and foremost. I didn’t come here today in hopes that my story would somehow touch your heart. I have seen you ignore the 10,000 victims before my son, and I have seen you ignore the thousands of victims after him. But instead I came here today to make history, because one day you will not be able to ignore these injuries and these deaths any longer. But most importantly, I came here today to honor my son, Baby Remi. When I see Remi again, I will be able to tell him that I did not give up on him and that I did not give up on the truth. Remi passed away 6 months ago approximately 12 hours after he received his CDC-recommended vaccinations at his 2-month appointment. The autopsy came back “anaphylactic adverse reaction to the multiple vaccinations received the day prior” in black and white, clear as day, listed as a concerning directly resulting in my son’s death. Remi had MTHFR (Methylene Tetrahydrofolate Reductase), which is a gene mutation that affects the body’s ability to detox and get rid of neurotoxins that are ingested, inhaled, and injected. MTHFR affects the central process of methylation. Folate is an important vitamin that your body needs to start the methylation process. Individuals with MTHFR have problems absorbing folate, leaving them deficient, ultimately hindering the methylation process. Methylation increases sulfation and the production of the master antioxidant glutathione. These two aid in excreting heavy metals, toxins, and pathogens out of the body. Without this essential process, you are at risk for adverse reactions and toxicity up to and including death. It is known that one-third of the population has an MTHFR mutation, and it is speculated that more than half have some variation of MTHFR. Coroners are refusing to do simple post-mortem tests to see if the deceased is positive for MTHFR. Coroners are not even testing the brains of these infants, which is where we all know the adverse reactions happen. How can you say that vaccines are safe when no testing is being done on healthy infants that pass away hours after they receive a vaccination or 8 of them? Better yet, why are we not doing genetic testing on every infant prior to any vaccinations?

I’m Kevin Tuttle, a former Air Force Officer, father of 2, as well as President of the Adverse Events Recovery and Information Center (AERIC), which helps fund recovery to the people injured by your decisions. I sat down the other day to watch Netflix and, as happens to every middle-aged man, I decided to watch a World War II documentary. It occurred to me while watching this that you people are going to be in a heap of trouble when the Nuremberg Tribunal- like trials happen here after your crimes against humanity are uncovered, because what history shows us is that truth prevails. My grandmother survived a Nazi regime that eventually crumbled due to what the world finally saw was happening—mass murder. Your tyrannical regime is also crumbling. The people are rising up against this slow Holocaust you’re inflicting upon us. You can’t hide the truth from parents who have witnessed vaccine harm. I read this week that your buddies at the WHO recently revised how adverse events after vaccination are classified so that if a child with a heart condition, for example, gets vaccinated and then dies, it was his heart condition that caused his death and not the vaccine. Isn’t that convenient? Tell me how that’s ethical. It’s shocking how a product that isn’t safety tested, isn’t tested for carcinogenicity or mutagenicity, and has no liability can be so revered amongst medical professionals. What you call “science” is simply marketing and people are seeing through it. For instance, people know that acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) is polio triggered by the oral polio vaccine (OPV). Changing the name doesn’t change the condition. Your lies are being uncovered. The lies that come from this board and the CDC cause far more sickness and death than measles, chickenpox, whooping cough, and all the other diseases there are vaccines for combined. Let’s take a look at some of your lies. Your slogan of “safe and effective”—the definition of “safe” is, “protected from or not exposed to danger or risk.” “Effective” means “successful in producing a desired or intended result.” Clearly, your products aren’t safe, since the Supreme Court ruled they were unavoidably unsafe and countless testimonies prove their danger. I can only presume your intended outcome is to injure and kill, so I'll let you have the “effective” portion of that. You should be sued for misleading advertising. When you tell patients that they need GARDASIL® or they will get HPV (human papillomavirus), that is a lie. When you say the flu shot is the best way to protect yourself from the flu, that is a lie. When you tell the new mother that her baby is in danger unless it receives the Hep B moments after birth, that is a lie. Vaccines don’t cause autism. That is a lie. Remember the Tuskegee Experiment? Their lives could have been saved, but those in authority watched them suffer and did nothing to help, much like the Nazi leadership. How is what you’re doing here any different?

FEB,2020,Dr. Debra Wexler,"Family Physician,Executive Director, Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) ","Good afternoon. I’m Debra Wexler, family physician and Executive Director of the Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) in St. Paul, Minnesota. I would like to say some words about access to vaccination today, because I think it remains a problem for many people who live in our country and I hope we can do more to address it. IAC got started after the measles epidemic in 1990 when across our nation, 166 people, primarily very young minority children in poor neighborhoods died and 11,000 were hospitalized. Measles took a big toll in the Twin Cities, and everyone in public health worked long hours to stop it. We had hundreds of children infected with measles. Three of our city’s Hmong refugee children died within a few days of each other in May of 1990, all around 1 year of age. These children were generally unvaccinated for many reasons: making an appointment was difficult if you didn’t speak English, lack of transportation to a clinic, and fear of receiving a bill was always present. There was no Vaccines for Children (VFC) program then. So, how did we stop measles in 1990 in our city? St. Paul Public Health led the charge, and this is the 50 people who were part of that charge. They and many others throughout the city helped, including my Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), La Clinica. We held weekly walk-in immunization clinics days and evenings throughout the city in public housing projects, community centers, with clinics, and in churches that served meals to the hungry. There were always nurses and multi-lingual staff on site to talk to people to vaccinate them on the spot. Many other cities did the same. That’s how many under-vaccinated communities became protected against measles in 1990. Local public health departments were going out to the people. Thank you local public health for all you did. But today, access problems continue with clinics still not easy to get to, language barriers, lack of health insurance, and reluctance to seek care for fear of deportation. And as we all know, today there is serious compounding factor that did not exist 30 years ago—the prevalence of anti-vaccine messaging. I think that we as healthcare professionals should once again be working closely with local public health to determine strategies for providing direct immunization services in under-served neighborhoods and ethnic communities where vaccination rates are low. Thirty years ago, I saw up close and personally the power of such an approach in protecting the lives of children.

I am a General Pediatrician from Salt Lake City, Utah at Busy Bee Pediatrics. I am the Medical Director of this independent pediatric practice. As a pediatrician, I am very familiar with conversations about immunizations. I have daily conversations with parents and caregivers about vaccines, the vaccine schedule, discussing vaccine safety, as well as reassuring my patients that yes, they will feel a little poke, but it is for a very important reason. Because we live in a world of global travel, an epidemic of measles or the reintroduction of polio is essentially a plane ride away. Globally, 1 in 5 children are not receiving life-saving vaccines. Vaccinations help stop the spread of communicable diseases. We are currently waiting on a vaccine for COVID-19. Unfortunately, during this COVID-19 global pandemic, many childhood vaccines have already been missed or delayed. My mother-in-law contracted polio when she was 11 years old before vaccine was available. She shared the following with me, “I got polio in the summer of 1950. The doctor made my parents take me to the city hospital where I was immediately put in an iron lung. I remember the room being filled wall-to-wall with children in iron lungs. It was terribly, terribly frightening. I was lucky that I wasn't in an iron lung very long. My polio was not as severe as others who died or were paralyzed for life, like my aunt who got it at the age of 37—the mother of three young children.” It was shortly after this time the Dr. Jonas Salk developed the polio vaccine. Having polio influenced her decision to become a nurse, and she made sure that her own 4 children were vaccinated, and she encouraged her patients to get their children vaccinated. She says that now she is 82 years old and has post-polio syndrome (PPS). Polio has affected her her whole life. The messages from my mother-in-law are clear and simple. Diseases cause illness and illnesses make people sick. We are lucky to live in a time of amazing scientific discovery and during the time when vaccines are available to reduce the impact of many scary and harmful diseases. Vaccines are safe. All vaccines are tested in thousands of people before they are licensed and are monitored extensively after being made available to the public. Vaccines are necessary. We live in a global world. We all know that diseases may be brought into the United States by those who travel abroad or from people visiting from areas with current outbreaks. This is what is happening now. COVID-19 is a highly contagious communicable disease. Currently, we are all at risk. Under-immunized children are similarly at risk for all other preventable communicable diseases. Vaccines save lives. Vaccinations work. I wish that my mother-in-law had been protected from polio. Luckily, my children are. My patients are. Vaccines have protected all of my families.

JULY,2020,Michaela Jackson ,"Prevention Policy Manager , Hepatitis B Foundation","Thank you. My name is Michaela Jackson and I am the Prevention Policy Manager for the Hepatitis B Foundation, a national nonprofit dedicated to finding a cure and improving the quality of life for those affected by Hepatitis B. An estimated 2.2 million Americans are living with chronic Hepatitis B. While significant progress has been made with childhood vaccinations, adult vaccination rates remain low. Today, only 25% of all adults have completed the HepB vaccine series. We urge ACIP to consider a recommendation for universal Hepatitis B vaccination to help address these low rates and missed opportunities within guidelines. Current risk-based guidelines are difficult to implement. They ask providers to assess 13 different risk factors to determine if an adult should be vaccinated. If you add up all of the factors, that covers up to 84% of the US population. With such a high percentage of adults meeting vaccination recommendations, it makes the most sense to recommend universal adult Hepatitis B vaccination. There are up to 80,000 new cases of Hepatitis B each year. It is essential to note that the HepB vaccine is considered the first anti-cancer vaccine due to its ability to prevent primary liver cancer, the second deadliest cancer in the US. The 5-year survival rate of liver cancer is just 18%. If left unmanaged, 1 in 4 individuals living with chronic Hepatitis B will develop liver damage or liver cancer in their lifetime. Approximately 63% of the US population were born before ACIP’s childhood immunization recommendations potentially leaving them susceptible. Within this vulnerable population, the recent rise in incidence of HepB cases has increased the most amongst 30- to 49-year-olds attributed to the opioid epidemic. Although people who use drugs are recommended for vaccination, reported acute HepB cases have ranged from between 56% to 457% in states heavily impacted by the crisis. Such data is concerning in light of COVID-19 where multiple states have reported stopping or limiting their prevention and outreach services for STIs (sexually transmitted infections), including viral hepatitis. The pandemic has also emphasized the need for increased adult Hepatitis B vaccination efforts. Recent reports show that those living with liver diseases like Hepatitis B are more likely to have severe reaction to coronavirus, especially if the condition is uncontrolled. As many people infected with Hepatitis B are unaware due to a lack of symptoms, preventing this infection is critical to not overwhelming providers and hospitals during the pandemic. In closing, the United States has committed to eliminating viral hepatitis by 2030 but that cannot be done without addressing the low HepB vaccination rates amongst adults. Yesterday was World Hepatitis Day, the date chosen to honor Dr. Baruch S. Blumberg who discovered the Hepatitis B virus and created the first Hepatitis B vaccine. We have the tools to effectively eliminate HepB in the US, but continued support and resources are needed to fully utilize them.

JULY,2020,Ann Lewandowski,"Program Manager, Southern Wisconsin Immunization Consortium (SWIC) Founder, Wisconsin Immunization Network (WIN) ","Thank you. My name is Ann Lewandowski and I am the Program Manager for the Southern Wisconsin Immunization Consortium (SWIC) and the Founder of the Wisconsin Immunization Network (WIN). I would like to thank you for your time and effort in reviewing vaccines. Your work as an independent advisory council is something I often point to in my work promoting the safety and efficacy of vaccines. My comments today stem from my personal experience in seeking vaccines as an individual with an autoimmune disorder. I was pleased to hear the question being asked if patients with immunocompromising conditions or medications will be included in the studies during an earlier discussion. However, I was a bit concerned that the answer was not clear-cut. I bring this up due to my experience seeking the SHINGRIX vaccine. I have requested to receive it based on a history of shingles. I have been advised not to receive it due to a theoretical risk of relapse. I have been advised that the studies for those with autoimmune conditions are ongoing and more information will become available at some future point. Data coming in the future was not helpful when I had a shingles outbreak last year. Specific data on immunocompromising treatments would enhance public confidence of those with disorders and the doctors who treat them. Many of those who face autoimmune disorders have had challenges being diagnosed and often become distrustful of “traditional medicine,” with many becoming ripe for negative theories about vaccines. In fact, I just had a discussion yesterday about vaccines supposedly causing my disease. Even with the CDC’s vaccine myths page, the person continued to point to a vaccine insert as proof that the vaccine caused harm. We must make significant efforts to overcome the distrust of those impacted by these diseases and these groups to ensure that COVID vaccine is widely accepted. Listening to the treatment options, I was also concerned about the suggestion that monoclonal antibodies are a treatment therapy. I actually receive an antibody therapy every 6 months and it is designed to deplete my adult B-cells. There remain significant questions on whether or not I am able to produce an immune response to a vaccine, and if I will have a compromised immune response to the vaccine if I do mount one. Additional study would be important in understanding a good allocation of resources and, again, building public confidence. As we look to a new vaccine for a novel virus circulating the globe, I hope you consider stories like mine when making recommendations to the CDC and even Operation Warp Speed (OWS). Clinical trials must include a broad spectrum of the US and should consider differences in immune status and therapies with biologics. Thank you.

JULY,2020,"Paul Darden, MD",Pediatrician & Head of General and Community Pediatrics University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center ,"Thank you. I am Paul Darden. I am a Pediatrician and the Head of General and Community Pediatrics at the University of Oklahoma in Oklahoma City. Much of my career has been spent working with clinics in the community to measure and help them deliver preventive services to children. This has actually meant a lot of work on the delivery of routine vaccines, as these are the most effective in preventing illness and death in children. Certainly, early in my career, I cared for many children with vaccine-preventable diseases (meningitis, dehydration from rotavirus gastroenteritis, and even some tetanus). I don’t really miss those days and I don't want them to come back. Thanks to vaccinations and other healthcare advances, it is far less common for a pediatrician like me who practices in a tertiary medical care center to see any of these diseases. We are now in the middle of a worldwide pandemic, which is affecting all of healthcare and actually especially preventive care of children. We are also preparing for a new vaccine against COVID-19. One of the things I’m hearing in Oklahoma that really should be addressed is around the safety of the new vaccines, and really, I was thrilled with the conversation today around safety assessments. Those safety assessments need to be communicated. It needs to be layered and emphasize the planned safety assessments, especially with the new technologies. In addition, there really is a need to support practices to safely provide needed routine vaccinations in addition to the COVID-19 vaccine, including influenza vaccine. This might include support for or promoting funding of alternative venues for immunization, including funding to increase local health department direct delivery of vaccines, mobile vans, and pharmacies. One of the clinics I oversee has actually delivered more vaccines and another, because of the constraints of the facility, much less. I do want to say that I applaud the difficult work the ACIP does and actually really appreciate their guidance. I thank you for doing that work. Thank you.

JULY,2020,Chief Gary Ludwig,"President, International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) ","Good afternoon. My name is Chief Gary Ludwig. I am honored to serve as President of the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC). Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today about the importance of prioritizing firefighters and EMS personnel with respect to the COVID-19 vaccination program. Firefighters and paramedics are part of the health care delivery system. Even though we are in public safety, we are still healthcare workers. We are the warriors at the tip of the spear. When you see all of the outstanding work being done in the hospitals for COVID-19 by doctors, nurses, and others, please do not forget how those patients got there. The vast majority were transported there by ambulance. The fire service is the largest provider of emergency medical services in the United States, transporting some 30 million patients last year. Unfortunately, as of today, we have documented 60 firefighters—that’s 60 firefighters and EMS personnel—who have died from coronavirus as a result of being infected on duty. Additionally, over 1,000 firefighters have been infected and over 10,000 have been quarantined after being exposed. Many of these patient encounters did not occur in a sterile environment but were in the patient’s home or on the street. This increases the likelihood of infection and exposure. Fire departments are still reeling from earlier decisions to not prioritize first responders for access to PPE and COVID-19 testing. We are seeing shortages occurring again related to PPE and COVID-19 testing. Shortage are so bad that some fire departments are out of disposable PPE and must use ponchos and rain jackets. States are not prioritizing fire departments in opposition to federal guidance to receive PPE. I applaud the federal government for its Operation Warp Speed program; however, it is vital that fire and EMS personnel be placed at the highest priority tier once a vaccine is available. Fire and EMS personnel often are in close and sustained contact with members of the public and each other due to the unique demands of their jobs. EMS personnel provide hands-on patient care and routinely treat both low-acuity medical emergencies as well as provide advanced life support services such as intubation and resuscitation. Even non-EMS trained firefighters are normally trained in CPR and are in close physical contact with members of the public when providing CPR, rescuing them from car accidents or confined spaces, or are interacting on fire scenes. One New Jersey firefighter even died of COVID-19 that he contracted while responding to a homeowner who reported a gas leak emergency. In closing, the IAFC strongly urges the ACIP to include firefighters and EMS personnel on the highest priority tier for receiving a COVID vaccine when it is available. As we face increases in the number of COVID-19 patients and looming hurricane and wildland fire seasons, it is critically important that we protect our first responders. Thank you for your service for developing answers to these difficult questions. The IAFC stands ready and willing to assist the ACIP in any way possible.

JULY,2020,Claire Hannan,"Executive Director,Association of Immunization Managers (AIC) ","Good afternoon. My name is Claire Hannan. I have the privilege to serve as the Executive Director of the Association of Immunization Managers (AIC), the very individuals and public health agencies that strive daily to ensure the timely immunization of every child, teen, and adult in this nation. My comments are based on 23 years of working in public health where I’ve had the opportunity to learn from federal, state, and local health officials and to partner with public health advocates. I am grateful to the ACIP for asking the important questions, collecting and analyzing the critical data, and holding open review sessions for the public. As Dr. Messonnier stated, a successful COVID-19 vaccination campaign depends on so much more than clear recommendations from ACIP. Vaccine allocation, distribution, administration, and tracking will not happen without careful planning and coordination between all levels of government. Funding for CDC and state and local public health agencies is urgently needed. Public health departments at all levels are stretched thin. Staff with immunization expertise have been pulled into other aspects of pandemic response and some have been furloughed due to fiscal deficits. Therefore, resources are sorely needed to build and implement the COVID immunization program that will follow from the ACIP guidance. Coordinated planning between CDC, Operation Warp Speed, and state and local public health agencies is needed immediately as Dr. Messonnier stated. There are critical unknowns that must be addressed. Will allocation of vaccine doses and vaccine ordering be conducted through the existing CDC distribution system? Precisely what role will the Department of Defense (DoD) and the military play? Will the vaccine be provided free of charge to all Americans with no out-of-pocket costs regardless of insurance status? What data elements will vaccine providers be required to report to states and what elements will states be required to report to CDC? What kind of public engagement and communication plans are in place to assure the public will accept the vaccine and trust the oversight systems ensuring ongoing safety and effectiveness? These are just a few of the important logistical issues that public health agencies are grappling with as we race to prepare in advance of vaccine implementation. Immunization Program Managers and their partners in public health agencies stand ready to work with representatives from Operation Warp Speed and CDC. I was pleased to hear Dr. Messonnier mention more concrete micro planning and CDC technical assistance. We welcome this. Every awardee needs this collaboration with CDC to begin now with a sense of urgency. We are all in this together. As we face the greatest public health challenge of the century, we will all rise to the occasion. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

My name is LJ Tan. I am the Chief Strategy Officer for the Immunization Action Coalition. I also serve as a Co-Chair for the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit (NAIIS). Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comment to the committee. First, my deepest appreciation to each and every member of this committee for the amazing work that you do to ensure that the vaccines given to our population are extremely safe and effective. As a previous liaison member to this committee, I understand the work that you all do to consider all the data that are available. I am grateful that experts such as yourselves are engaged in these complex discussions that ultimately result in an ACIP recommendation for the use of the vaccine. I believe that as you develop recommendations for use of COVID-19 vaccines, and I have to shout out to today’s excellent presentations, you must continue to maintain ACIP’s high standards for evidence, clarity, and transparency as your deliberations proceed. In particular, I was pleased to hear Dr. Romero’s comment that the National Academy of Medicine’s (NAM) COVID-19 panel considering prioritizations of target populations is being collaborative with the ACIP. The importance of unifying the multiple deliberations surrounding the recommendations for use of any COVID-19 vaccine cannot be overestimated. Data should be considered and discussed collaboratively together to arrive at unified, evidence-based recommendations for target populations, administrations of vaccines, and other vaccine utilization recommendations. When we were developing pandemic plans for influenza, the ACIP and the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) developed a joint working group precisely for this reason of consistency. Should that not also be considered for developing recommendations for use of the COVID-19 vaccines and include the NAM panel? Your partners at the Immunization Action Coalition and National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit stand ready to help implement your important recommendations on COVID-19 vaccine. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the importance of #notwindemic this fall season. A double, or twin epidemics, of flu on top of COVID-19 disease would be devastating. Couple that with the fact that flu and COVID-19 share multiple overlapping high-risk populations increases the significance that we do our best this fall season to #takefluoffthetable. To that end, it is important that we talk about expanding the influenza vaccination season, not just extending it. This season in particular, we need to start vaccinating people appropriately once vaccine is available and continue talking about and giving flu vaccinations through December and into 2021. We must reassure providers that it is alright to utilize the entire flu vaccination season to advocate for and give flu vaccine. Once again, thanks to this committee for all the incredible work that you do to keep our country safe from vaccine- preventable diseases.

JULY,2020,"Alicia Stillman, MBA, MPH",The Emily Stillman Foundation ,"Hi, my name is Alicia Stillman. I am from the Emily Stillman Foundation and also the Meningitis B Action Project. In February of 2013, I lost my 19-year-old daughter, Emily, to meningitis B just 36 hours after her first symptom. I am not only here today to tell you my sad story. I’m here as a concerned citizen and advocate committed to making sure that this doesn’t happen in other families to other children. First, I’d like to comment on the critical importance of immunizations during COVID-19. At the time of Emily’s death, the meningitis B vaccine was not yet available to protect her. It is today, but amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the vaccines available for deadly infections like meningitis B are sitting idly on the shelf. Immunization rates among children have fallen by 60% to 80%. We’re seeing states like Pennsylvania that have temporarily suspended requirements for children’s immunizations to enter schools. If children and young adults are not receiving these recommended vaccinations, they are now vulnerable to infections, potentially deadly diseases like bacterial meningitis, and so are the communities they live in. Postponing these vaccinations is not the answer. It is irresponsible and dangerous. Preventing vaccine-preventable diseases should be part of our COVID-19 response. I urge the CDC and ACIP to be very public and vocal about the importance of immunizations during COVID-19 and to ensure that states maintain their requirements and schools and colleges revisit their vaccination mandates before any student is allowed to return to campus. Second, I’d also like to comment on the current language used by the ACIP to describe the meningitis B vaccine recommendation. As you know, it changed from a Category B recommendation to a shared clinical decision-maker. First, it is important that you know that this discussion is not happening consistently, making the recommendation obsolete. A recent CDC-funded study found that 49% of pediatricians and 69% of family physicians do not discuss the menB vaccine during routine visits for their 16 to 18-year-olds. Second, providers are not always interpreting this recommendation correctly. For the last 5 years, I have traveled the country talking to doctors and nurses and there’s such confusion about what this means. It’s not an equitable approach and I urge you to revisit that. In closing, I want to thank every member for your hard work for protecting all of our communities.

JULY,2020,"Alison Singer, BA, MBA","Founder & President, Autism Science Foundation (ASF) ","Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to speak today. I’m Alison Singer, Founder and President of the Autism Science Foundation. I am the mother of a child with profound autism and legal guardian to my older brother, who also has very severe autism. The Autism Science Foundation’s mission is to support research to uncover the causes of autism and develop evidence-based treatments for people with autism. As we all recall, back in the late 1990s, there was concern that autism might be caused by vaccines. At that time, I shared that concern. But dozens of research studies have indicated that this is not the case and that vaccines do not cause autism. Fortunately, the vast majority of our families have been convinced by the weight of this evidence and have vaccinated their children. It took a lot of hard work to reassure the community that vaccines are safe and effective. My concern today is that efforts to fast-track a COVID-19 vaccine could undo all of that work if time isn’t spent making sure that any vaccine recommended by this committee is safe and effective. To that end, we must complete Phase 3 trials on a COVID-19 vaccine. We must do the studies to see if the vaccine works and we must do the studies to make sure the vaccine does not cause uncommon side effects. Without full Phase 3 trials, we risk undermining all of the progress we have made over the past 21 years to restore public confidence in our vaccine program. It is critical that we take all actions necessary to continue to build and maintain trust in the science that supports the nation’s vaccine and public health recommendations. Thank you very much.

JULY,2020,"Melody Butler, BSN, RN, CIC",Founding Executive Director/President Nurses Who Vaccinate (NWV) ,"My name is Melody Butler. I am the Founding Executive Director for Nurses Who Vaccinate. Our mission is to help nurses become vaccine champions in their workplaces, communities, and on social media. I’d like to thank all the presenters and members of ACIP for very informative presentations and insightful questions and concerns about these life-saving vaccines. I’d like to touch upon Dr. Sarah Mbaeyi’s presentation where she addressed the need to prioritize COVID- 19 vaccinations among the healthcare personnel populations. As the Executive Director of Nurses Who Vaccinate, our members are quite familiar with the need for resources and education to keep nurses up-to-date with the latest immunizations and medical recommendations. As the most trusted profession in America, nurses have an obligation to honor that trust and to follow evidence-based practices. I’d like to ask the committee and partners for their support in engaging the nursing community to help encourage and increase vaccine confidence not only among patients, but also among the healthcare community as well. A recent WebMD® reader poll found that fewer than half of people plan to get a coronavirus vaccine in the first year it is available. An even smaller group say they will get it in the first 90 days. If immunizations are low, we will not be able to achieve the level of community immunity that we need to protect us from coronavirus. We have raced to develop and test an effective vaccine and people are questioning the ability to create one so quickly that could work well and be safe. When we are dealing with a population that has 30% of adults with low health literacy, it is critical that we provide transparency and adequate patient education to help patients understand the science and development of these vaccines that we are working so hard to promote. There is a need to start working on vaccine confidence and the nursing community now by providing more behind-the-scenes information on the vaccine development process, resources to accompany the final results, and tools to help explain the study of outcomes. Providing more transparency on the hard work and dedication that is going on in the vaccine research centers will help provide those in the frontlines of education opportunities and resources to educate and get ahead of vaccine misinformation. In conclusion, we would like to thank the ACIP members, CDC staff, scientists, and researchers working on these life-saving interventions. We look forward to working with the many organizations and health partners to help advocate and prevent vaccine-preventable diseases. Thank you.

JULY,2020,"Michelle Fiscus, MD, FAAP","Medical Director,Vaccine-Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program (VPDIP) Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) ","Good afternoon. My name is Dr. Michelle Fiscus. I am a physician, a pediatrician, a mom, and the Medical Director of the Vaccine-Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program (VPDIP) at the Tennessee State Department of Health. Over my 20 years in medicine, I have provided tens of thousands of vaccines to children, including my own children, and not once in those 20 years have I seen a serious adverse event (SAE) caused by a vaccine. What I have seen are children with chronic neurological disease due to chicken pox, infants admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) due to pertussis, and children who have died from influenza. All of these diseases are vaccine-preventable. Yesterday, a study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Annals of Internal Medicine that looked at the safety of vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These Israeli researchers looked at every vaccine approved between 1996 and 2015, 57 vaccines in all, examining safety-related changes made to vaccine labels since a vaccine’s release. Most safety-related label changes were triggered by surveillance systems like the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). More than 40% of the warning updates were related to latex allergies due to changes in packaging or the increased risk of fainting after certain vaccines. The other 60% were related to restrictions on who should be given some vaccines, such as those with certain immunocompromising or pre-existing medical conditions, some premature infants, and pregnant women. In only one instance was a vaccine removed from the market due to safety concerns, that being the RotaShield® vaccine used to prevent the most common cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in infants and resulting in 20 to 40 deaths in the United States each year. When more than 20 years ago, VAERS signaled an increase in a type of bowel obstruction after the administration of this oral vaccine, this committee, the ACIP, concluded that the vaccine should no longer be recommended and the manufacturer voluntarily pulled it from the market. That decision was made after 15 infants were found to have this complication. The risk was 10 cases per 100,000 doses of the vaccine or 1/100 of 1%. It took 7 years for a new vaccine to be developed, studied for efficacy and safety, and released. It is estimated that that vaccine prevents as many as 50,000 hospitalizations of babies and young children each year in the United States. If there were no vaccines, approximately 42,000 of the more than 4 million children born in the United States each year would die early deaths as a result of diseases we can currently prevent. This new study adds yet more evidence that vaccines are remarkably safe, that surveillance systems like VAERS and the work of the ACIP ensure that safety and that vaccines are one of the greatest achievements in public health. I thank this committee for its commitment to the health and well- being of all Americans, especially our children, and I encourage every parent to provide their child with the protections provided by vaccines.

JULY,2020,"Stanley Plotkin, MD",Emeritus Professor of Pediatrics Perelman School of Medicine University of Pennsylvania ,"Thank you for giving me the first opportunity in months to speak about something besides COVID-19. What I want to tell you about is an article that will be published shortly in Clinical Infectious Diseases (CID). Cody Meisner and I had a simple idea and that is to look at the vaccine compensation system [National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP)]. The people compensated by this system have had either real or likely reactions to vaccines, so we have numbers on the number of awards. We also have numbers concerning the doses of each vaccine that have been given over a period of years. We analyzed the number of vaccines given between 2006 until the end of 2018 and compared that with the number of awards. It turns out that something close to 4 billion doses of vaccines have been given and the number of awards works out to 1.3 per million doses. So, that gives you a very concrete idea of what the real reactions are to vaccines. I should add that much of that is due to influenza vaccine awards which are, as you know, the result of misplaced vaccinations in the shoulders. So, if you removed those from the calculation, the number would be 1 or less per million doses. So, that gives you real ideas, real numbers, about reactions to vaccines. That paper will be published in Clinical Infectious Diseases. It is already, I think, out in pre-print. I hope that the members of the committee and others will use those figures in talking to parents. I thank you for your attention.

I’m a Professor of Law at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. I want to make three points to the committee. First, I want to reinforce the point made by several other commenters and by Doctors Lee, Bell, and Romero in a recent JAMA piece, which reminds us of ACIP’s long history of professional careful oversight of United States vaccines that some of the commentators already talked about, ACIP’s procedural guarantees of transparency, and ACIP’s broad membership in their workgroups makes its role in overseeing vaccine safety not only important generally, but crucial when we move forward with the COVID-19 vaccine process. I urge the committee, and I urge supporters of public health to support them in this, to do everything in their power to maintain full information and the ability to exercise the careful oversight that gives us such an incredible and safe vaccine supply. We need ACIP involved in COVID-19 vaccine. I know it is not completely in your power, but I want to reiterate that it is your duty and you’re doing a public service when you do everything you can to maintain oversight. Second, I want to remind the COVID-19 Vaccine Workgroup that as you discuss vaccine priorities that you are working within a Constitutional framework and not just a scientific one. I haven’t seen a legal person on your workgroup, and I think it’s important to get a Constitutional expert, especially if you consider issues like race. Finally, I want to urge the committee when in the future days you can get back to having in-person meetings to consider limiting public comments to written comments only. I say that with regret because I would have hated to have missed some of the comments I have heard today. But as you know, in the past few years, anti- vaccine activists have used this platform of commenting before the committee to create videos of short speeches, basically using common themes to create theater and propaganda to promote anti-vaccine stance. The CDC background makes the comments look official. That is not the goal of public commenting. ACIP does not have to provide that opportunity. Legally, you can choose to allow public participation and commenting to be in writing only. I hope you seriously consider doing this at least for a while, even though I realize it will cause issues. Public participation is important, but providing an opportunity for theater isn’t. Thank you again for all of your hard work in the public service and for keeping our children safe. Thank you.

JUNE,2020,"Elizabeth Sobczyk, MSW, MPH","Director, Strategic Alliances Gerontological Society of America (GSA) ","Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments today. GSA honors aging across the lifespan and is the oldest and largest multidisciplinary organization devoted to research, education, and practice in the field of aging. GSA hosts the National Adult Vaccination Program (NAVP) with the purpose of affecting policy and improving adult immunization rates. We routinely bring together stakeholders to make recommendations that address the specific needs of older adults on topics such as influenza vaccination, raising vaccination rates in long-term care facilities (LTCF), and understanding shared clinical decision-making best practices. Despite the health benefits that result from implementation of ACIP recommendations, vaccines have been consistently under-utilized in the adult population. This year, public awareness of the importance of vaccines is heightened as it relates to COVID-19. As influenza season is approaching and education campaigns are advanced, we respectfully request that the CDC communications underscore the importance of older adults receiving all ACIP-recommended vaccines. Likewise, we respectfully request that there is an increased emphasis on the importance of vaccinations of people who care for older adults in close care settings, especially nursing homes and home care. Additionally, we request that specific consideration be given to the unique immunologic challenges that older adults present. Immune responses to influenza vaccines decline with age, reducing effectiveness. We know the evidence that certain vaccines work better for older adults. Finally, we ask for considerations for guidance that makes all adults feel safe in receiving vaccinations in their chosen locations this year and moving forward. Providing these communications through healthcare providers in the Aging Network will give older adults and their caregivers the confidence to receive the recommended vaccinations. GSA recently published a fact sheet titled, “Aging and Immunity: Why Older Adults Are Highly Susceptible to Diseases Like COVID-19.” This fact sheet highlights the process for developing a COVID-19 vaccine and discusses changes in our bodies as we age that impact immunity, all the more reason to ensure older adults receive all ACIP-recommended vaccines. GSA supports the ACIP’s and the CDC’s efforts to increase vaccination rates in all adults and, in particular, older adults and those who provide care for them. We are please to support your efforts and to work with advocates to amplify those messages through the Aging Network in order to raise awareness, improve access, and increase utilization of vaccines for adults.

JUNE,2020,"Ms. Amy Pisani, MS ",Executive Director Vaccinate Your Family (VYF) ,"Our organization seeks to protect people of all ages from vaccine-preventable diseases. For nearly three decades our organization, along with our partners in public health, have developed many successful strategies to ensure that every individual has access to life-saving vaccines. Vaccines are one of the most important tools we have to keep families and communities protected against highly contagious diseases. We at VYF want to make certain that parents and individuals continue to feel confident that vaccines given to protect lives remain both safe and effective. After a vaccine is licensed and recommended for use in the United States (US), there are 4 systems in place that work together to help scientists monitor the safety of vaccines and identify any rare side-effects that may not be found in clinical trials. We remain highly confident in the robust vaccine safety systems in place here in the US, including the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the Post-licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring Program (PRISM), and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project, all of which are described on our website. VYF has a policy in place expressly supporting the recommendations of the ACIP and the immunization schedules voted on by this well-informed body of independent experts. ACIP’s recommendations are the foundation upon which our nation’s successful vaccine program is based. In order for the public to have confidence in the safety and effectiveness of future COVID vaccines, it will be critical that decisions be driven by science and the decision-making process must be transparent. To that end, we urge that the ACIP and Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) be involved in the evaluations of the data of vaccine candidates and deciding whether and how these vaccines should be available to the public. ACIP sets the standard of care for vaccines and providers rely on the committee to set the parameters for clinical care. Insurance coverage is based on the recommendations as well as Vaccines for Children (VFC) coverage. It is, therefore, imperative that any COVID vaccine recommendations for our nation are set forth by the ACIP who can offer detailed recommendations for each population. Only this committee has the history of expertise and the trust of the healthcare community and the public. We remain confident that this committee will take action to monitor safety data on current and future vaccines, including those for COVID-19, to ensure the safety as soon as they begin to be put to use. In closing, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us what those in public health have suspected for many years. Chronic under-funding and neglect of our public health infrastructure has left us vulnerable to infectious diseases. Unfortunately, vaccines are only effective if people receive them. Yesterday, VYF released a special “State of the ImmUnion” report of the issue of COVID vaccination preparedness. In this brief report, we examine the 5 steps Congress must take to strengthen our country’s vaccine infrastructure and ways to help constituents understand the value of vaccines. We urge members of the public and this committee to read our report by visiting our website: www.vaccinateyourfamily.org. Thank you so much for your time and thank you for what you do every day.

JUNE,2020,"Michelle Cantu, MPH","Director, Infectious Disease and Immunization,National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) ","Thank you to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for your commitment to providing evidence-based recommendations, your votes today, and for the presentations on COVID-19 vaccinations this afternoon. Our mission is to improve the health of communities by strengthening and advocating for the nation’s nearly 3000 local health departments. We know that nearly 90% of local health departments provide direct immunization services to both adults and children. Further, they conduct essential immunization activities such as surveillance, providing education, and developing communication campaigns. As the world and nation face this historic pandemic, it is important to highlight that local health departments have been and continue to be on the frontlines supporting their communities. In a recent assessment, NACCHO explored the impact of COVID-19 on local immunization programs. Results indicated that 88% of local immunization program staff were re-assigned to respond to COVID-19, nearly 90% indicated that essential immunization program services have been impacted, and 62% reported a noticeable decline in vaccination coverage rates. Alarmingly, state and local public health officials have reported an increase in job losses, resignations, and threats from the public as they recommend public health guidance to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 in their communities. Regardless, public health remains committed and dedicated to addressing vaccine coverage, prioritizing health equity, promoting vaccine confidence, and preparing for the upcoming flu season. During this unprecedented time, and in preparation for a COVID-19 vaccine, local health departments are being called upon to review vaccination protocols and explore strategies to reach vulnerable populations. In addition, we are focused on vaccine confidence, which is critical to assuring that vaccines are widely accepted. NACCHO commends the ACIP for your quick assembly of an ACIP COVID Work Group. As the ACIP continues to factor evidence- based recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination and weighs vaccine prioritization, NACCHO encourages the continued consideration of these implications as public health and partners prepare to implement them and ensure confidence among the communities they serve. To ensure the successful deployment of vaccine and acceptance among the population, the field turns to the ACIP for clear guidance, defined priority populations, strong recommendations that assure safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, and support for the established coordinated vaccine delivery systems.

JUNE,2020,"Mrs. Karen Anklam, MS ",Light Up the Night for Norah ,"I am a healthcare professional with a Master of Science in Nurse Anesthesiology and a mother of 4. Four years ago yesterday on June 23, 2016, I took my healthy, vibrant, 1-year-old twins to their 1-year pediatrician appointment. At that appointment, they received a clean bill of health as well as PCV-13, Hib, HepA, and MMRV immunizations. What we did not receive that day was informed consent. Informed consent would have included that MMRV carries double the risk of febrile seizures as MMR and V given separately. This would have been useful information as my son had a history of febrile seizures. I believe that this was recommended in the sake of compliance because I had asked that day for the first time since becoming a parent to split or delay some of those shots. Nora died 7 days later on the night of June 30th into July 1st of what experts now believe was a terminal febrile seizure. The known peak of febrile seizures after measles-containing vaccinations is day 7 to 10. Her fraternal twin sister, Lucy, continued with a fever day 8 post-vaccination to day 15 post-vaccination, which was the day of Nora’s funeral. ACIP already recommends that ProQuad® not be given to kids under age 2 unless at the request of a parent. I have now met other parents whose children had their first febrile seizure post-MMRV, later dying official of indeterminant causes. Febrile seizures are typically thought to be innocuous and that children grow out of them. However, a study published in JAMA in April 2019 found that almost 30% of deceased children of unexplained causes had a history of febrile seizures compared with 3% of the general population. In Pediatrics July 2010, they concluded that there is an additional 1 febrile seizure for every 2300 MMRV vaccinations given. That additional febrile seizure was my daughter, Nora, and it ended her life. What I am asking for today is that my understanding is that this committee approves the recommended schedule in October. What I am asking for today is that a Work Group be made to re-evaluate MMRV’s use in kids under age 2. Once your family or child is a statistic, the numbers are no longer comforting. It has been 1454 days since my daughter died. Please consider removing ProQuad® for kids under age 2. The risk of febrile seizure is known to be double.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak. I am speaking with you from my home in San Mateo County, California. I support and am involved with a number of public health advocacy organizations, such as Voices for Vaccines (VFV), VYF, and Vaccinate California, today I am speaking only for myself. I have just one point today. I have been observing the grassroots opposition to immunization for over 2 decades. This opposition is extremely well-funded unlike the pro-public health, pro-science, pro-vaccination organizations such as those I mentioned previously, VFV, VYF, and state-level organizations such as Vaccinate California. In my opinion, the opposition to routine vaccination is an enormous threat to public health in ordinary times. In these extraordinary times, it is even more threatening. My ask is simple. Could there be an ACIP Working Group on Advancing Immunization Acceptance. Increasing confidence in the safety and efficacy of immunization across the lifespan is always critical, but in this setting, paramount. Having a Work Group to understand the opposition to immunization would do a great deal to advance the acceptance of immunization. Thank you all to members of the committee.

JUNE,2020,Robert Blancato,National Association of Nutrition and Aging Services Programs (NANASP) ,"I am pleased to make my testimony to ACIP. On behalf of the National Association of Nutrition and Aging Services Programs (NANASP) and the 4 million adults that we serve every day, I am here to make a specific request of the committee. My request is to suspend until the end of the pandemic your June 2019 recommendation for shared clinical decision-making between patients and providers of the PCV-13 pneumococcal vaccine. I make this recommendation for the following reasons. The first is a new reality caused by the pandemic with fewer older adults visiting any healthcare provider (HCP) where the shared clinical decision-making discussion would take place. The second real concern and consequence in maintaining shared clinical decision-making is that fewer older adults will be vaccinated against pneumonia at a time when we should be striving for greater vaccination rates. As we have noted previously, there is approximately a 66.9% overall pneumococcal vaccination rate for older adults. For African American and Hispanic older adults, the rate for PCV-13 vaccination is a full 10% and 15% lower than for white older adults, respectively. This pandemic has exposed the degree to which health disparities have contributed to the disproportionate rates in older minority adults who have contracted COVID-19. We cannot maintain policies that by their nature exacerbate disparities. Finally, we note that the guidelines for shared decision-making fail to address the very real issue raised in a Health Affairs article which noted that in a survey of over 650 family physicians, only 24% were able to correctly identify the definition of a clinical decision-making recommendation. In this time of great uncertainty for older adults, we certainly do not need any more confusion about an important issue such as being vaccinated. We urge you to add this recommendation to suspend to your agenda today or schedule it for some time in the very near future so it can be communicated to CDC. We are only a few months away from what is expected to be an active flu and pneumonia season. We need to do all we can to protect older adults from either and certainly from COVID-19. I also repeat our support for an earlier recommendation that ACIP add at least one member with expertise in geriatrics to better inform the work of the committee on issues of special significance to older adults. That expertise would have been beneficial during the June 2019 PCV-13 vote and would still carry important significance today. Thank you very much.",0,1,0,4,My request is to suspend until the end of the pandemic your June 2019 recommendation for shared clinical decision-making between patients and providers of the PCV-13 pneumococcal vaccine.,"rates, older, pandemic, pneumonia",5,The second real concern and consequence in maintaining shared clinical decision-making is that fewer older adults will be vaccinated against pneumonia at a time when we should be striving for greater vaccination rates,PCV-13,My request is to suspend until the end of the pandemic your June 2019 recommendation for shared clinical decision-making between patients and providers of the PCV-13 pneumococcal vaccine.,"As we have noted previously, there is approximately a 66.9% overall pneumococcal vaccination rate for older adults.

I am a Genomic Epidemiologist and Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School with expertise in ribonucleic acid (RNA) research, community engagement, and volunteer work with the [Mass General Brigham] Center for COVID Innovation (MGBCCI). Thank you Dr. Romero, Dr. Oliver, and the ACIP for the opportunity to share my comment on equity and leaving no one behind. In my op ed titled, “Refugees are Essential to the COVID-19 Response,” I described that 15% of refugees in the US work in the healthcare sector. These refugees need to be included in the COVID-19 vaccine Phase 1 distribution strategy. To “Leave No-One Behind,” I suggest that you consider these four E’s: 1) Equity in including refugees; 2) Empowering communities with trust and transparent communication; 3) Extreme weather preparedness; and 4) Enrichment of trained vaccine providers. Next, I’ll go through these 4 E’s to “Leave No-One Behind” in greater detail. First, equity. Evidence shows that immigrants, including refugees, are over-represented in the healthcare personnel, but they have less access for their own healthcare. Healthcare workers with patient-facing roles, whether they are a refugee or a citizen, should be included in Phase 1a. Second, refugees and migrants are essential workers in the food industry, but suffer a disproportionate burden of incident COVID- 19 and this subgroup should be included in Phase 1b. Number two, to empower communities, both urban and rural, with transparent and trust communications on vaccine products, coupled with public health strategies such as masking and physical distancing, is essential. Evidence shows that synergy in messaging with local leaders will enhance equitable uptake. Third, extreme weather preparedness with back-up generators and additional sources of dry ice will enable equitable distribution to vulnerable communities devastated by weather-related events, such as hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and wildfires on the Northwest Coast. Fourth, enrichment of trained vaccine providers. Since the healthcare system is overwhelmed by the current surge, we need additional nurses and community healthcare workers with instructions on how to assess quality of the messenger RNA (mRNA) upon arrival and how to thaw and dilute the different vaccine products to ensure equitable shots in the arm across the country. In summary, the 4 E’s that I’ve presented are: 1) equity and inclusion of refugees; 2) empowering communities with communication; 3) extreme weather preparedness; and 4) enrichment of trained providers. Thank you for listening and thank you for leaving no-one behind.",1,0,0,4,These refugees need to be included in the COVID-19 vaccine Phase 1 distribution strategy.,"refugee, migrants, local, mRNA",0,0,0,"To “Leave No-One Behind,” I suggest that you consider these four E’s: 1) Equity in including refugees; 2) Empowering communities with trust and transparent communication; 3) Extreme weather preparedness; and 4) Enrichment of trained vaccine providers.

NOV,2020,Ms. Evangeline Wang,Public Health Outreach Coordinator Hepatitis B Foundation ,"Thank you. My name is Evangeline Wang and I am the Public Health Outreach Coordinator at the Hepatitis B Foundation. We appreciate the opportunity to speak at today’s meeting. Amidst this COVID-19 crisis, low adult vaccination rates, and the opioid epidemic, the hepatitis B (hepB) community is deeply concerned about the current guidelines’ ability to protect vulnerable communities from new hep B infections. We urge ACIP to consider a recommendation for universal hepatitis B vaccination to help protect susceptible populations. In the spring of 2020, the American Journal of Managed Care (AJMC), the American Medical Association (AMA), the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), and several other expert institutions noted that the pandemic is exacerbating the opioid crisis. This comes at a time when current public health emergencies hinder national and state public health programs like viral hepatitis prevention. Recent data suggests that community-based organizations (CBOs) saw their hepatitis vaccination efforts reduced by 42% and 52% of these community-based organizations surveyed have furloughed or laid off staff or reduced the size of their standard operations. With these changes, some of which might be permanent, and the steady rise of acute hepB infections, we must take action now to increase adult immunization rates. The ACIP recommendations are influential in national and state planning for hepatitis-related goals. The CDC’s Division of Viral Hepatitis uses the recommendations of ACIP to develop long-term strategies, including the most recent 5-year plan. The National Viral Hepatitis Progress Report, another key planning document for states and organizations aligns how they track and measure progress based upon the CDC reports. Therefore, ACIP’s recommendations have far-reaching consequences that go beyond identifying who should be vaccinated. The recommendations can determine where organizations focus their outreach efforts, where funding is allocated, and what actions need to be taken to improve vaccination rates. While high-risk groups are essential to prioritize, we cannot meet national hepatitis elimination goals without incremental changes. A recommendation for universal adult hepB vaccination would capture emerging at-risk groups and allow organizations to use resources to support more innovative strategies to vaccinate the broader adult population, of which just 25% of fully vaccinated. It is also important to note within the National Viral Hepatitis Strategic Plan for 2020-2025, the Division of Viral Hepatitis acknowledges that updates were needed to the ACIP’s adult HepB vaccination recommendations. Inclusion of the strategy as a way to increase adult hepB vaccination coverage confirms that the current recommendations are hindering progress towards elimination of hepatitis in the United States. In conclusion hepatitis B is a serious virus with potentially devastating consequences. We have a solution, but the support of ACIP is integral.

NOV,2020,Mr. Curt Macysyn,"Executive Director,National School Transportation Association","My name is Mr. Curt Macysyn. I am the Executive Director of the National School Transportation Association (NSTA). NSTA appreciates the opportunity to make comments in support of school bus drivers being classified as a high priority in the ACIP recommendation for phased allocation of COVID-19 vaccines. NSTA represents private school bus companies who provide pupil transportation services under contract. Keep in mind that student transportation is the largest transit sector in the United States. Nearly 500,000 school buses transport close to 26 million school children daily to and from school. That’s more passengers than transit, bus, rail, and aviation combined. Since we are a hybrid within the educational and transportation sectors, we want to ensure that school bus drivers are specifically addressed in your phased schedule. Needless to say, the last 9 months have been a challenging environment for us and we look forward to a complete return to the classroom for all students. But even with schools being closed, NSTA member companies have stepped up to deliver school nutrition meals, transported school supplies, and even provided Wi-Fi access to students. The most important element in achieving a complete return to the classroom will be to ensure an adequate number of skilled, trained, experienced, and licensed school bus drivers. But providing equity and access to in-school learning cannot simply be based on rhetoric and good wishes. NSTA estimates that 5% to 10% of industry bus drivers are currently sideline by COVID-19 and those numbers continue to rise. These drivers are infected, exposed, quarantined, and on leaves of absences. NSTA also estimates that approximately 33% of industry drivers are aged 60 and older and we are a racially and ethnically diverse group as well. To summarize, many school bus drivers remain fearful about a return to work without a vaccine. Targeting this group will certainly assist in the prevention of transmissions as well. School bus drivers are included on the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) list of “Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers.” They are listed in both the “Education” and “Transportation” sections of the latest version from 2020, and that was in August of 2020. Inclusion of school bus drivers on this CISA list validates that drivers are essential, and we believe this distinction is probative for the ACIP to consider as well. Without a healthy and plentiful workforce of drivers, more children may be forced into less safer ways to get to school and many may not have access to pursue their educational opportunities. Given the Advisory Committee’s membership of physicians involved in public health, we share some data points regarding the industry’s safety and environmental record. According to Department of Transportation (DOT) statistics, the school bus is the safest form of transportation for students, and we provide safety statistics in our written comments. In addition, one school bus takes 36 passenger vehicles off of the road. We appreciate the work of the Advisory Committee and we thank you for the consideration of our request.",0,1,0,4,NSTA appreciates the opportunity to make comments in support of school bus drivers being classified as a high priority in the ACIP recommendation for phased allocation of COVID-19 vaccines.,"transportation, student, children, bus, school",0,0,0,NSTA appreciates the opportunity to make comments in support of school bus drivers being classified as a high priority in the ACIP recommendation for phased allocation of COVID-19 vaccines. ,NSTA estimates that 5% to 10% of industry bus drivers are currently sideline by COVID-19 and those numbers continue to rise. ,
NOV,2020,"Ms. Sue Peschin, MHS",President & Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Alliance for Aging Research ,"Good afternoon. I’m Sue Peschin, President & CEO of the Alliance for Aging Research (the Alliance). The Alliance supports the National Academy’s framework and we ask ACIP, as you do your important work, to please keep the following in mind. First, it is critically important to ensure that nursing home and home health care staff are vaccinated in the first days, given the high-risk nature of their care population and the rate of transmission in congregate settings. Additionally, in communities were hospital capacity has become constrained due to current infection rates, home health staff for filling the gap to support older adult COVID-19 patients in the home. Next, we support the vaccination of older adults in congregate settings given the patient acuity and proximity of the resident population. COVID-19 cases in long-term care facilities (LTCF) account for 7% of infections but 40% of deaths. Vaccinating this population can also help speed the ability of facilities to restore visitation by family caregivers. In Phase 1a, we recommend the inclusion of long-term care pharmacists as frontline health providers. Pharmacists in these settings maintain medication access and support continuous adherence to therapeutic regimens for older adults in congregate settings. The Alliance also supports access for all other older adults in Tier 2. Adults 65 and older account for 16% of the US population and right now, 80% of all COVID deaths, even if an older individual doesn’t have a high-risk condition, immunosenescence contributes to higher vulnerability. We very much support the National Academy’s prioritization of equity as a cross-cutting consideration. The framework notes that in each population group, vaccine access should be prioritized for geographic areas identified through CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) or another more specific index. Of course, none of this is going to be successful without adequate resources for distribution, tracking, and monitoring to implement plans to vaccinate all Americans. Infrastructure investments must go toward strengthening, enhancing, and expanding the ability of public health officials and providers, including pharmacists practicing at the top of their license in the community, to make demands for a future COVID-19 vaccine and also reach populations who are currently under-vaccinated. The Adult Vaccine Access Coalition (AVAC) calls for at least $8.4 billion in funding to be directed to support this effort. AVAC also calls for utilizing existing infrastructure, such as Immunization Information Systems (IIS), to track vaccine doses as opposed to rushing to create new and untested systems. We also need to identify the biggest draw locations for different groups to get vaccinated: pharmacies, grocery stores, drive-through events, churches, or other places we have yet to think of. The Alliance is doing survey work on this that we’ll share very soon. Last, Dr. Redfield and Dr. Messonnier, to paraphrase from Dr. Redfield’s opening comments, thanks to you and your agency colleagues for staying in the arena and listening to the community. We need you now more than ever. Thank you.

NOV,2020,"Miss Nissa Shaffi, MS ",National Consumers League ,"That you so much, Dr. Romero. Good afternoon. My name is Nissa Shaffi. I’m here today on behalf of the National Consumers League (NCL). For over 120 years, the NCL has advocated on behalf of consumers who depend on vaccines as life-saving medical interventions. We appreciate the opportunity to speak on behalf of consumers today, and we extend our gratitude to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for its role in protecting public health. Upon release of an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, post-market surveillance will be imperative to determining its ongoing safety and efficacy. As a nationwide distribution effort commences, consumers will rely on public health agencies to communicate and respond to any potential adverse events (AEs) regarding the vaccine. Additionally, a fortified immunization information systems infrastructure will be integral in adequately marshalling vaccine resources. These measures will provide public health officials and providers with the necessary information to effectively administer and monitor vaccine activity. Consider the efficacy of multiple vaccine delivery methods, including an oral or nasal form, to provide Americans a vaccine where they live and meet a variety of diverse health needs. Assurance of innovative vaccine delivery methods has a potential to increase vaccine compliance and enhance overall uptake that could thwart the spread of the virus. As the polarization of public opinion continues, we must ensure that anti-vaccine sentiments do not foil critical public health interventions. We encourage ACIP to maintain effective public health messaging and clear vaccine recommendations to ensure that the American public feels safe and empowered in their decisions to vaccinate once a vaccine becomes available. Additionally, the pandemic has further illustrated inequities experienced by chronically underserved communities most vulnerable to health disparities. Specifically, Hispanic or Latinx, Black, and American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities have experienced vastly disproportionate rates of infection. An initial limited supply of the vaccine will only intensify these inequities. As such, we implore the CDC to designate Tier 1 priority for populations at the highest risk of contracting the virus with regard to equitable allocation of the vaccine. Finally, NCL requests that clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine are inclusive and reflects diverse subjects. People of color are significantly under-represented in clinical trials and under-treated in medical settings. Ensuring adequate representation in clinical trials would foster vaccine confidence across all demographics. In closing, to stem the tide of vaccine-preventable diseases, NCL submits these comments for review by the committee to ensure that consumers are afforded with safe and effective vaccines to combat the pandemic. Thank you so much for your consideration of our views.

OCT,2020,Mark Gibbons,President and Chief Executive Officer RetireSafe Organization ,"Dr. Romero and members of the committee, good afternoon. My name is Mark Gibbons. I’m President and CEO of the RetireSafe Organization. RetireSafe is an organization whose mission is to educate and advocate on behalf of older Americans on issues including Social Security, Medicare, health, safe retirement, and financial well-being. We believe that older Americans must have a voice in public healthcare policies that affect them. Older Americans are an important population. Currently, there are nearly 70 million Americans over the age of 60. Due to immune system decline as part of aging, as well as the prevalence of chronic disease comorbidities, many of them are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, and of course COVID-19. Vaccines for these and other conditions can truly be a matter of life or death for so many. We must keep this population, their increased risk, and their access needs at the forefront of vaccine development and ACIP consideration. One of our major concerns is a need for more expertise and representation for older Americans among ACIP members. As ACIP deliberates on important vaccine issues, we need to hear from experts who understand health factors and needs of older adults, as well as how their behaviors and lifestyles impact being able to fully benefit from these immunizations. The make-up of ACIP members should better reflect clinical expertise in these areas such as gerontology and the ability of vaccinations to work well for patients with chronic diseases and conditions often associated with advancing age. Even before the pandemic, older Americans face challenges in accessing care. The pandemic has obviously made that worse. There is a clear need to not only develop new vaccines, but also to consider the technology and innovation of new methods of making them available, accessible, and usable to those who need them, including the potential for oral options. We believe that we need to incorporate that reality into ACIP thinking. We urge ACIP to be open to expansion of working groups and panel membership to include both clinical and cultural expertise. We need to keep looking at innovative platforms and solutions to providing immunizations to our vulnerable population. Please let our voices be heard. Thank you.

OCT,2020,Joanna Colbourne,"Deputy Executive Director,National Foundation for Infectious Diseases","Good afternoon. Hello, my name is Joanna Colbourne. I am the Deputy Executive Director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, or NFID. The 2020-2021 influenza season is expected to be characterized by an unprecedented dual threat, co-circulation of influenza and the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. In addition, amidst the pandemic, immunization rates have decreased for recommended vaccines across all age groups, with demand plummeting as much as 95% for some vaccines. We must reverse this trend now to avoid seeing outbreaks of flu and other vaccine-preventable diseases across the country. Influenza, or flu, and COVID-19 can be dangerous for anyone, but for more than 6 in 10 US adults living with a chronic health condition, including heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes flu and COVID-19 may be especially dangerous. Adults with chronic health conditions experience an inflammatory reaction caused by influenza infection that can worsen their underlying disease and lead to a number of serious outcomes including hospitalization, heart attack, or stroke, catastrophic disability, and death. To make matters worse, many of the underlying health conditions that make adults vulnerable to flu are also linked to increased vulnerability to COVID-19. Although there is currently no approved COVID-19 vaccine in the US, there are safe and effective vaccines they can help protect against flu and many other vaccine- preventable diseases. To address this urgent public health threat, NFID has launched the “Keep Up The Rates” flu awareness campaign in recent months. “Keep Up the Rates” is a national campaign to encourage all individuals to receive recommended vaccines that may have been delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, more than 100 leading organizations have joined and are sharing information and resources in support of this critical public health initiative. Earlier this month, NFID released a new “Call to Action: The Dangers of Influenza and COVID- 19 in Adults with Chronic Health Conditions,” which was the result of a multidisciplinary roundtable to explore the potential impact of influenza and COVID-19 on adults with chronic health conditions. The campaign includes more than 35 leading medical organizations that are sharing best practices for administering flu vaccines amidst COVID-19 mitigation efforts. NFID and its partners are urging all healthcare professionals, particularly specialists treating adults with chronic health conditions, to implement strategies from the “Call to Action” and utilize tools or resources from the “Keep Up the Rates” campaign, all of which are available at www.nfid.org. It is the responsibility of all healthcare professionals to educate, motivate, and insist that patients prioritize annual flu vaccination this season and stay up-to-date on all recommended vaccines. Thank you for your time and attention today and special thanks to the members of ACIP for the work you continue to do.",0,1,0,5,We must reverse this trend now to avoid seeing outbreaks of flu and other vaccine-preventable diseases across the country,"co-circulation, flu, vulnerable, chronic",0,0,0,“Keep Up the Rates” is a national campaign to encourage all individuals to receive recommended vaccines that may have been delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. ,"Influenza, or flu, and COVID-19 can be dangerous for anyone, but for more than 6 in 10 US adults living with a chronic health condition, including heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes flu and COVID-19 may be especially dangerous.

OCT,2020,Michael Arnold ,Parent and Activist ,"Yes, hello. My name is Michael Arnold and I’m here to talk about vaccine problems and solutions. Vaccines are not tested against placebo, saline, and manufacturers have no liability for serious injury or death. Vaccine ingredients, as explained by Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, have many toxins in them such as aluminum, formaldehyde, mercury, polysorbate 80, and aborted fetal tissue deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). There is a chart from the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), December 2000, which shows how vaccines did not play a major role in the decline of disease. It was clean running water. The book, “How to End the Autism Epidemic” by J.B. Handley explains in Chapter 5 how aluminum plays a major role in the autism epidemic by causing encephalitis. In the book, “Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective?” by Neil Z. Miller, there is a graph. Doctors, pediatricians, were surveyed and they were asked about the Hepatitis B vaccine, and 87% said they did not believe that that vaccine was necessary for their patients. Okay, well there’s Justice for Evee. Evee died 36 hours after her vaccinations. The Medical Examiner (ME) said it was because of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), but Evee’s mother is fighting for a tissue sample so that she can prove that it was actually VIDS, vaccine-induced death syndrome, not SIDS. Christopher died shortly after the GARDASIL® vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV). You can learn about him from learntherisks.org and #neverforgetChris. Adam got autism after his wellness visit like thousands of other babies, and you can learn about that from the documentary about him. Solutions. Take Hepatitis B off the schedule as soon as possible. Ask Congress to terminate the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA)of 1986. Ask Congress to change vaccines from a biologic to a drug. Ask the CDC and WHO to get clean water and proper sanitation for the world’s poorest 1 billion people and work with the Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB), bacb.com.

OCT,2020,Kimberly Hall,Florida Freedom Keepers ,"Good afternoon. My name is Kimberly Hall. When I was 25, I lost twin girls at 23 weeks gestation. The doctors told me it was unexplainable. My twins would be 5 years old this year. I am 5 years still recuperating from the memory of the profound pain, confusion, trauma, and complete upheaval of my entire life. It was at 22 weeks with the nurse taking my basic vitals requested me to take a shot for pertussis. When I stated that I didn’t know what pertussis even was, the nurse shortly explained to me that it would protect me from obtaining this disease and alongside that, I would be passing on protection to my twins. I was not given any further information about this medical intervention. What information is there really that shows it  provides any protection that she claimed? What is available states that a Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) study, and I quote, “While all groups possessed robust antibody responses, key differences in T-cell memory suggest that aP vaccination induces a suboptimal immune response that is unable to prevent infection.” There is also available a 2017 review of 15 published articles that determined that while vaccination boosted maternal antibodies, evidence was lacking on whether or not this had any impact on reducing the incidence of pertussis, serious complications, or death in infants. It seems the Tdap vaccine does not prevent the spread of disease or even prevent you from catching the disease. If today I pull up the CDC website, I very clearly see that the CDC recommends pregnant women to get the whooping cough vaccine between 27 and 36 weeks of each pregnancy. Why was I offered this at 22 weeks? That nurse represents this country’s entire lack of any informed consent with these injected biologics. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified Tdap as a Category C drug because of this complete insufficient evidence regarding any administration in pregnant women. The argument is used that it could be seen as unethical to test such a vaccine, but it is being pushed and coerced on woman every day as a complete off-label use. Furthermore, the FDA has never even approved a vaccine specifically for use in pregnancy to prevent disease in the infant. I was not given any information of the injected ingredients: formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, aluminum hydroxide, polysorbate 80, phenoxyethanol, ammonium sulfate. In what doctor’s insane mind does this ingredient list seem like an injectable concoction for a pregnant woman carrying an undeveloped fetus? Why is it the GARDASIL® package insert reference to page 10, where it shows the use in populations of pregnancies within clinical trials? The GARDASIL® vaccine contains 225 micrograms of aluminum hydroxide and 7 of 55 women lost their babies (12.7%). GARDASIL® vaccine was made with more than a 50% increase of aluminum, 500 micrograms and 17 of those 62 women lost their babies. That percentage spiked up 27.4%. It is shown through the studies and science that aluminum hydroxide alone plays a major role, causing fetal demise and spontaneous abortions with the Tdap containing more than 300 micrograms. The CDC and vaccine manufacturers are both completely exempt from liability, exempt from providing randomized control trials (RCTs), and exempt to provide any evidence to do what you claim it will do and only to show it could create antibodies. That doesn’t equal immunity. It is awfully disappointing that in 2020, we have such a widespread knowledge deficit within the scientific community. Thank you.",1,0,0,2,"The argument is used that it could be seen as unethical to test such a vaccine, but it is being pushed and coerced on woman every day as a complete off-label use","pertussis, disease, consent, evidence, pregnancy",1,The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified Tdap as a Category C drug because of this complete insufficient evidence regarding any administration in pregnant women. ,"Tdap, Gardasil, pertussis",0,"The GARDASIL® vaccine contains 225 micrograms of aluminum hydroxide and 7 of 55 women lost their babies (12.7%).

OCT,2020,"Albert Faro, MD",Vice President of Clinical Affairs Cystic Fibrosis Foundation ,"Good afternoon. My name is Dr. Albert Faro and I’m the Vice President of Clinical Affairs at the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CF Foundation). On behalf of the foundation, thank you for this opportunity to provide comments to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices regarding developments in allocation of COVID-19 vaccines. The CF Foundation is a national organization actively engaged in the research and development of new therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare life-threatening genetic disease that affects over 30,000 people in the United States. The build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs characteristic of the disease makes people with CF particularly prone to chronic airway infections, punctuated by pulmonary exacerbations, events associated with morbidity and mortality in people with CF. A significant proportion of pulmonary exacerbations are triggered by respiratory viral infections. With continued progression of the disease, individuals with CF and advanced lung disease may pursue lung transplantation. Due to the known risks posed by respiratory viral infections, the unique dangers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the multi-system manifestations of CF, some people with CF, such as those with advanced disease or who are post-transplant and therefore immunocompromised, should be considered at high-risk for poor outcomes from COVID-19 infection. The strongest evidence to date on the dangers of COVID-19 for people with CF comes from a forthcoming global analysis of 181 COVID-19 cases among people with CF. From that analysis, it appears CF patients with advanced lung disease and those that are post-lung transplantation, are at risk of severe outcomes, including death. We therefore urge the advisory committee to consider information beyond the CDC’s list of comorbid conditions to inform prioritization determinations. That list may mischaracterize the true risk for some rare disease populations like CF. We further urge the advisory committee to give equal priority to anyone with a condition that puts them in a high risk for severe disease from COVID-19 instead of adopting the National Academy of Medicine’s (NAM) recommendation to first prioritize people with multiple comorbid conditions for access to a vaccine—a focus that relies on multiple conditions and neglects other indications of disease severity and vulnerability. We believe that scenario inappropriately disadvantages someone whose underlying disease condition is advanced or severe. This segment of the population should be prioritized for early access to a vaccine and includes patients with CF with advanced disease or who are post-transplant. Thank you again for your attention and consideration of people with CF as you tackle these critical issues.",0,1,0,4,"On behalf of the foundation, thank you for this opportunity to provide comments to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices regarding developments in allocation of COVID-19 vaccines.","cystic fibrosis, allocation, high-risk, immunocompromised",0,0,0,This segment of the population should be prioritized for early access to a vaccine and includes patients with CF with advanced disease or who are post-transplant.,"Due to the known risks posed by respiratory viral infections, the unique dangers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the multi-system manifestations of CF, some people with CF, such as those with advanced disease or who are post-transplant and therefore immunocompromised, should be considered at high-risk for poor outcomes from COVID-19 infection.

OCT,2020,Del Bigtree,"Founder,Informed Consent Action Network ","I want to thank the committee for giving me this opportunity to speak. I want to say that, you know, given that almost everything we talk about these days involves discussion of COVID-19, I want to say I found it shocking that in the discussion about the flu shot this morning, there was no discussion about the risk of COVID-19 being increased by flu shots, given the fact that there’s so many studies that are showing this type of connection. Specifically, we have the Cleveland Clinic study that’s entitled “Safety of Influenza Vaccine During COVID-19.” It found a highly statistically significant increased rate of mortality, ICU admission, and hospitalization for COVID-19 among those that received a flu shot in 2019 as compared to those that did not. In fact, it reflected that those receiving the flu shot in 2019 had a 175% increased rate of mortality and a 195% increased rate of ICU admissions. Additionally. There was a gigantic study that just came out looking at 39 countries called “Positive Association Between COVID-19 Deaths and Influenza Vaccine Rates in Elderly People Worldwide.” Given that there are those studies and studies out of Japan that have shown 400% increased risk in other upper respiratory infections amongst those that got flu shots compared to those that didn’t. All of this science around the world is pointing to there may be a real danger to giving flu shots during COVID-19, yet the CDC seems to plow forward with this idea of a twindemic and using it as a way to force the largest flu vaccine campaign in US history. We’re also watching the 59 deaths from flu shots and growing in South Korea where they are involved in this mission, yet none of this seems to matter to you at the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices, which is really shocking. Given the lack and waning confidence that the American public now has in the CDC, it seems by many articles to be at the lowest point in history, how do you expect to be relevant or even be considered necessary in a process of protecting our population when you’re not even having the most obvious conversations you should be having when it comes to vaccinations. This is your world. This is what you’re supposed to be looking at. We are supposed to have confidence that when there are studies all around the world showing a risk of delivering a flu shot vaccine and the increased risk of death from COVID-19 that certainly it’s a conversation and you’ll be able to bring up studies to discount or, you know, somehow refute this issue. Instead, you avoid it altogether, which is continuing to drive the confidence in the work that you do down to the floor. I would like to see you be a little more responsible with these conversations, given that they are so important and may include and involve the risk of death for hundreds of thousands if not millions of people in this country and around the world.

OCT,2020,"Erin Olszewski, RN ",US Citizen ,"Yes. Hello. Good afternoon and thank you for having me today. My name is Erin Olszewski and I’m a Registered Nurse (RN). This year, I also became a COVID whistleblower who uncovered the fraud, negligence, greed, and unnecessary deaths being covered up in New York City’s (NYC’s) Elmhurst Hospital and the CDC at the height of that pandemic, with actual video and audio indisputable proof. So, we both know the numbers you’re basing your new COVID vaccine recommendations off of are inflated and fraudulent. You cooked the books on vaccines just like you’ve been cooking the books on COVID. You’ve rigged the studies, you’ve covered up the data, you’ve buried the injuries and deaths, you’ve removed yourselves and the vaccine manufacturers from all liability, and you’ve lied to the American people long enough. I needed to alert the American public to something they may not know. There is a CDC scientist whistleblower named Dr. William Thompson who the CDC is attempting to cover up. Dr. Thompson discovered that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was causing a dramatic rise in autism in African American boys. However, his CDC bosses have ordered him to silence. I believe that this is the year of the whistleblower and accountability, especially as it relates to our minority populations. Most recently, yesterday in fact, whistleblower Tony Bobulinski came forward exposing even more fraudulent activity happening within our government. If there is any hope in recovering the trust of Americans, the executive government needs to step up, do what’s right, and immediately subpoena Dr. William Thompson and all his CDC co-authors to testify before Congress. Congressman Bill Posey here in Florida has thousands of damning CDC documents Dr. Thompson handed to him. If forced to testify, Dr. Thompson stated he’s not going to lie. The public deserves the truth before this panel continues their unethical practices of adding even more vaccines to the already overly crowded, toxic, liability-free schedule. Each one of you on that panel know that the science has been corrupted. Yet, you continue to dish out fraudulent data because money, power, and greed is much more lucrative than protecting public health. The CDC and mainstream media continue to bury this information. They know that vaccines are causing detrimental harm and death to children and adults. Yet here we are today watching you discuss a fast-tracked, liability-free COVID vaccine for a virus with a 99% survival rate. A quote from your very own silenced CDC scientist, Dr. William Thompson, in 2004 to Dr. Brian Hooker, “That’s the deal. That’s what I keep seeing again and again and again where the senior people at CDC just do completely unethical vile things and no one holds them accountable. Your time is running out, because the American people are waking up and accountability is coming for you mark my words. First, do no harm.

OCT,2020,Susie Olson Corgan ,Representing Self ,"Hello. My name is Susie Olson Corgan. Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak today. I have been attending the ACIP meetings, as well as Board of Health (BOH), Department of Justice (DOJ), and National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) meetings. The thread among these meetings has been vaccine hesitancy. The one thing I have heard many of you say is that vaccine hesitancy is due in large part to anti-vaccination campaign. As you know, most of these campaigns are carried out on social media. However, social media censorship is at an all-time high. Major platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Linked-In, Vimeo, and even search engines like Google are frequently removing contents and banning accounts without warning or explanation that even has the slightest appearance of questioning the current vaccination program. Despite the fact that this information is being censored, vaccine hesitancy is still on the rise. Some of the reasons that people are questioning vaccine are the following:  the withholding of the COVID-19 vaccine trial data, lack of transparency regarding adverse events (AEs) in the trials, using another vaccine as the placebo—a placebo to be an inert substance, concurrent studies phases, lack of liability if something goes wrong—and this applies not only to the COVID-19 vaccine candidates, but also to those currently on the recommended childhood vaccination schedule, partnerships with organizations such as the Gates Foundation to create marketing campaigns, and questioning whether there has been corporate capture of our regulatory agencies. I know that some of these issues are out of your scope, but you have enormous influence among the medical and scientific communities worldwide. They will consider any recommendations that you make. I urge you to consider increased transparency throughout this process. Vaccine hesitancy will continue to rise and if and when a COVID-19 vaccine candidate is approved for distribution, supply will not be your primary issue—demand will be.

I am the President Elect of the American College of Correctional Physicians (ACCP). I’d like to thank the academy for allowing me to give this presentation on behalf of the inmates and correctional workers throughout the country. Just yesterday, there was a news release that 75% of inmates at the Marquette Michigan Prison were positive for coronavirus. In addition to that, 42% of the employees were positive. Also, about a month ago, there was an article about in Virginia, 70% of the inmates were positive. Inmates’ rate of infection of coronavirus is 5 times that of the general population and the death rate is 1.5 times that of the general population. Correctional workers and inmates go home. They contract the illness, disease, coronavirus, within the institution and conceivably can spread it to their family, friends, neighbors, stores, and wherever they may be. Ninety percent of inmates are released at some point in time. They, too, are our friends, family, and neighbors. In a correctional facility, it is extremely challenging to follow the CDC guidelines of masking, sanitizing, and distancing. Consequently, it is a big challenge to keep them safe. In October, the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) developed a framework of prioritization for coronavirus. It was Phase 1b in rural facilities where there are older patients with comorbidities in congregate settings, and Phase 2 for employees and inmates in correctional facilities. I will be submitting a resolution to the American Medical Association (AMA) along these same lines that hopefully in November will be approved.

OCT,2020,Kermit Kubitz ,Individual ,"Thank you. I am 73 years old and was a polio pioneer in 1954. My wife and I have just gotten our flu shots in the last two weeks—in my case, the high-dose flu shot. I support Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of COVID-19 vaccines showing preliminary efficacy and safety with the 3 following recommendations. First, there should be a substantial review of effectiveness for a group of 5,000 to 10,0000. Second, use new serology methods to study immune response. Third, give similar EUA approval for follow-on vaccines, including those with adjuvants for better protection. On the first point, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine may be uncertain. Uncertainty results from the novel technologies used, the possibility of differential effectiveness for different groups, and the number of degrees of freedom (i.e., behavior variability among trial program participants, including NPIs; that is, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as masks and social distancing). Therefore, I recommend follow-up studies of effectiveness, not just safety, in approximately 5,000 to 10,000 vaccinated patients, including stratified groups of older patients and those with other health conditions. Second, follow-up on effectiveness for vaccinated patients should include serology studies to permit evaluation of the types of immune responses resulting from vaccination. Just as we are using novel vaccines such as mRNA, we should use innovative serology techniques such as the Multiplexed Identification of T-cell Receptor Antigen (MIRA) available now. Third, the FDA and CDC must be prepared through EUA follow-on vaccines which show greater effectiveness or duration of immunity. This should include single dose vaccines or vaccines using newer adjuvants like AS03 or CPG1018 which can stimulate a stronger immune response. But in order to do this, that is included follow-on vaccines, the FDA and CDC also need to understand and evaluate the effects of multiple vaccination iterations (i.e., what if you get an mRNA vaccine and then a subunit or inactivated virus vaccine?). We need to understand what happens if you have antibody response to a subsequent vaccine. Thank you for your work. Keep it up.

OCT,2020,"Antony Hsu, MD, FACEP","Clinical Emergency Physician,American Colleges of Emergency Physicians","Good afternoon, ACIP. Thank you for what you do. I’m an actively practicing Clinical Emergency Physician with a concern for my family, children, community, city, state, nation, and humanity in that order. I’m not an epidemiologist or health care economist, but I do know a few and as a frontline emergency physician balancing community practice and academic pursuits with national advocacy, I base my advice on the more than 60,000 patient encounters and diverse work and life background I have had. The topics I’d like to address first are SARS-CoV-2 vaccine safety concerns that I’ve heard and thought about while working on an Indian Reservation in Montana in September: 1) Regarding generating trust on sufficient testing and safety, open up the books about side effect profiles of each vaccine. Transparency is needed in times of rationing to promote trust in government; 2) Consider community nomination committees to reach out to social influencers, faith-based, elected government representatives, and medical and scientific representatives for trust-building teams; 3) Consider anonymous polling by a panel of renowned experts about whether they would immunize themselves and their families, but their votes must remain anonymous to engender trust; and 4) Consider ranking the efficiency of each vaccine for each population profile. On the second larger topic of vaccine distribution, my thoughts are: 1) Ensure complete informed consent based on continuously updated benefit and risk profiles; 2) Consider buy-in for healthcare workers and gradually broadening the enrollment as safety and efficacy numbers are sustained and continuously reevaluated; 3) Consider calculating a relative risk reward or r3 ratio for each person. This r3 ratio addresses the risk of vaccination versus the risk of delayed vaccination. Gradually slide scale the availability based on the r3 ratio. This can defer depending on local, regional, and national priorities. The r3 ratio method might avoid the concern of favoritism with an A, B, C, D or a 1, 2, 3, 4 approach and replaces it with a straightforward sliding scale. Each manufacturer can then provide what their sliding scale criteria are, especially since the safety profile for each vaccine may differ; 4) As availability improves, consider peer navigators and influencers discussed previously to step up messaging; 5) The nation must buttress its system for the distribution of preventive healthcare. Specifically, emergency departments (EDs), which operate 24/7/365 already vaccinate for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. They have not been included in outreach, but they are at the frontline for pandemic responses. There are pilot projects in the States of Michigan and Washington that vaccinate for influenza and hepatitis A. Hospitals have the facilities to store vaccines that require extremely low temperatures and have security 24/7; and 6) EDs are uniquely positioned to work with public agencies for the work of mass immunization to ensure all people can be reached, including those facing homelessness and the underinsured for whom Eds may be the most likely source of care.

OCT,2020,Kim Freitas ,Mother ,"Hello, and thank you for the opportunity to speak. I would like to discuss some critical areas of concern regarding the COVID vaccine. It is unethical to vaccinate a person using a high-risk, untried, liability-free vaccine when you have a safe and proven medicine available. Per the CDC, over 98% of the population recovers from COVID-19. We cannot risk injury to an otherwise healthy person using a vaccine we know very little about. One of the biggest areas of concern is enhanced illness, when the vaccine triggers a reaction which causes a person to acquire the exact virus you are trying to protect them against. We have seen this happen in previous coronavirus animal trials, which are currently being skipped during COVID trials. These trials are also being conducted on healthy people, yet the vaccine is due to be administered to our most vulnerable populations first, who typically have the health issues with at least 1 if not 3 underlying conditions that makes them high-risk. How can we use an untested vaccine on them when we have no idea what the outcomes will be? Also, how can we disperse a product that is free from liability, especially a warp speed vaccine using mRNA technology that has never been used before? No contraindications have ever been studied regarding administering the COVID vaccine with other vaccines. This means it should not be administered in the same day, week, or even month with other vaccines. Who is going to monitor and control that? Which leads to my next concern, viral priming. This occurs from the heavily pushed flu vaccine. Studies have shown that the flu vaccine makes us 36% more likely to get an upper respiratory illness (URI), which includes COVID-19. We should be warning against use of the COVID vaccine for those who have already received the flu vaccine. Let’s also be very clear that the recipient of the vaccine should be given the vaccine insert—not a short list of information. True informed consent involves knowing all of the risks, not just watered-down points. Lastly, we must have transparency from the Data and Safety and Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) who oversee these trials. J&J, AstraZeneca, and Oxford trials only provided fragmented information that we are not clear about adverse reactions during the ongoing trials. At one point, transverse myelitis was mentioned by the media, but then the wording was changed to a much vaguer language on the trial patient information sheets. In closing, we demand tested, tried, and proven vaccines that offer benefits greater than the already 98% recovery time with little to no interventions. These vaccines might be liability-free by the makers, but that does not make you, the advisory committee, morally free from the harm that can be caused by the decisions that you make. Please remember, where there is risk there must be choice. Thank you.

Federal offices have already declared their support for increasing hepB vaccine rates in the adult community. In 2017, the CDC promoted the elimination of hepB in the US and named low adult vaccine coverage as a major barrier to this goal. The same year, the CDC’s national Progress Toward Viral Hepatitis Elimination report stated that reducing acute hepB cases would take updating the CDC recommendations to target emerging at-risk groups and encouraging the implementation of vaccine recommendations. These suggestions are directly aligned with the National Adult Immunization Plan (NAIP) which notes that a lack of awareness, health care coordination, and recommendations by providers are significant impediments to increasing adult vaccination rates. The Healthy People 2030 framework has acknowledged that increasing acute hepB cases, which is largely due to the opioid crisis, in healthy adults between the ages of 30 to 59 is a concern and sets a goal to reduce new acute cases within 10 years. The universal hepB vaccine recommendation would be aligned with the current federal perspective of a need to fully utilize prevention tools. Health equity is a concern for the hepB community. Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and African immigrants continue to be disproportionately impacted by hepB. Together, these communities comprise up to 80% of all current hepB infections. Black and Hispanic individuals have lower rates of hepB vaccination than Whites, and individuals 50 years of age and older have hepB vaccine rates of just 16%. The inequities caused by hepB, however, are preventable and we must do what is within our power to reduce these growing disparities. In recent years, little progress has been made in increasing adult vaccination rates. Our experience with multiple high-risk communities and their providers shows that individuals may have a false sense of protection by having been given the hepA vaccine and the complexity of the current guidelines makes it hard for providers to establish risk. Individuals also may not be comfortable sharing risk factors like sexual history or drug use with providers, which makes it difficult to assess who needs to be vaccinated. A universal vaccination recommendation for hepB would make vaccination more accessible and reduce the burden to identify risk for providers. As guiding bodies, the CDC and ACIP have the power to lead the way towards a hepB-free future through a universal vaccine recommendation. Ultimately, this recommendation has the ability to promote health equity among some of the most vulnerable communities and prevent hepB which, in turn, can prevent liver cancer and save lives. Thank you so much for your time today and allowing me to speak.

SEPT,2020,"Karen Ernst, MA","Director, Voices for Vaccines (VFV) ","Thank you. My name is Karen Ernst. I am the Director of Voices for Vaccines (VFV). I represent the public, most of whom do vaccinate. I want to thank ACIP today for these incredibly important discussions about equity, transparency, and vaccine confidence. I do want to suggest that you are in a unique position to create vaccine confidence because of the work that you do here. Through your life’s work, many of you have proven that you are here today because of your desire to protect our communities from vaccine-preventable diseases, to bring this pandemic to an end, and to keep families safe from infectious diseases. But the public doesn’t know any of that. When they see CDC recommendations about COVID vaccines or routine vaccines, they do not know about the many hours that you spend in workgroups, and on phone calls, and in these meetings. They have never heard you debate a single word in a footnote in order to make a recommendation as useful and clear as possible. I would like to suggest that the public, in order to have confidence in your decisions, needs to know who you are. Too many of you do your work without any fanfare, but it is time to start introducing yourselves and your work to the public. The public needs to understand your independence and how you are often completely free of any conflicts of interest (COI). Most importantly, the public must understand as soon as possible the critical role that you are playing in making sure that any COVID vaccine they are offered by their providers have withstood your scrutiny enough to be deemed safe and effective. But they can’t know that if they do not know you. One last comment. The media is really fond of putting out polls and announcing how so few people want to get a COVID vaccine. We need you to respond to the media about how unfair it is to ask people about a vaccine that is still in trials, and to explain how you are prepared to do your part to make sure the vaccines are safe and effective so that when the vaccine is available, the public will know how safe and effective it is. I believe that you will do that work and I think that as the public gets to know you, they will believe it too.

It really is a privilege in this day and age to exercise our First Amendment rights: freedom of religion, speech, press, petition, and assembly. The media and CDC have done a great job of driving fear into the hearts of citizens. Many people don’t know any better and they are waiting on the CDC gods to make the next command. I can’t even keep up with all the ridiculous and very real scenarios we are living in. Drive through birthday parties and baby showers. Can’t sing Happy Birthday because of B and P sounds. The English language altogether may be harmful to speak. Don’t go within 6 feet of one another. The false positives and the skewed numbers. It spreads through the air. It doesn’t spread through the air. Websites that show Coronavirus testing kits ordered years ago in every country. I’m too awake for all this. We can huddle for riots, but not for celebration. We can go to the grocery store or the clothing store, but dressing rooms are closed. Bathrooms are open. Those of us who are awake know better. We haven’t gotten sick. Our kids haven’t gotten sick. More of my friends have died from suicide this year than the Rona. My friends who did get sick forwent any Western meds and they survived. Many still question if there’s even a virus. We do elderberry syrup, nettle tea, and fresh air, because masks constrict your oxygen levels and cells that are deprived of oxygen can turn cancerous. We don’t wear masks in our household and we never will. So what’s it going to be CDC? Because you are the God and we want our rights and freedoms back. And let me be clear, you’re not my God. I still have my freedom of religion. So you cannot force a mask on me. You cannot force a vaccine on me. I know it was said at the October 2019 meeting by someone here, “We cannot force vaccinations, but we can force compliance.” Well, your chess game is working for many people who are still stuck in the system, but I’m not. #IDONOTCOMPLY. You can delete and ban me off Facebook. You can try to silence our movement, but we are many and you all are aware that we know.

I am President and CEO of the Immunization Partnership. Our nonprofit mission is to eradicate vaccine-preventable diseases by educating the community, advocating for evidence-based public policy, and supporting immunization best practices. Thank you for developing vaccine recommendations to keep all Americans safe and healthy. Your scientific recommendations are an important tool that states use to carry out their Constitutional duty to protect the public’s health. Today, I would like to share some new data from the Immunization Partnership’s annual survey of hundreds of Texas parents. The good news is that 98% of respondents agreed that vaccines keep children healthy by protecting them from disease, and 97% agreed that following the ACIP-recommended vaccine schedule is best for their children. This is good news. It reiterates the public trust in the vaccine recommendations coming out of ACIP. But now for the bad news. We saw an alarming erosion in trust in government regarding vaccination, even among strong vaccine supporters. We saw a drop of over 17% in those who said they highly trusted the CDC as a source of information about vaccines. We heard reservations about a COVID-19 vaccine, including fears that the government was cutting corners and rushing through a vaccine before it could be tested to ensure it was safe and effective. And there were complaints about lack of transparency and concerns about political interference at the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This erosion of public trust will not be confined to the COVID-19 vaccine. If people cannot trust the process for one vaccine, why should they trust the process for any of the life-saving vaccines recommended by ACIP? This is my advice to the committee. You may be the last remaining group that can salvage this free-fall in public vaccine confidence. ACIP must hold the line for science, for transparency, for the public. This committee must operate as if the whole world is watching, because they are. Be transparent. Continue to hold frequent public meetings to showcase the transparency of your vaccine recommendation process. Hold dear to your integrity and the integrity of your process. Yes, we are in a global pandemic. Yes, we are in a national public health emergency. But do not take any shortcuts. Do not rush or appear to rush your COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. Go slow and methodically with your independent review of the data, because perception is reality. Even the slightest public perception that ACIP is rushing or cutting corners and their well-regarded recommendation process will sink the last public trust we have in vaccines.

I’m here representing the Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative (RWHC), a cooperative of 43 rural hospitals across Wisconsin. I would like to thank the committee for your efforts in reviewing the recommendations for potential COVID- 19 vaccines. The challenges posed by a worldwide pandemic and the consideration for allocating, distributing, and recommending a potential vaccine are complex and changing. I am very happy to hear that CDC and HHS partners are planning to engage with rural constituents, as many of the models I’ve heard are concerning from a rural perspective. Please consider how to deliver a vaccine to areas that are scarcely populated, older, and have less health infrastructure. Smaller minimum order sizes and clinics that can deliver vaccines to community- based clinics are critical to ensuring adequate vaccine uptake in this population, as is early engagement with the delivery system. Pfizer’s vaccine requires unusual cold chain consideration as does Moderna’s and has a minimum order of over 900 doses. During the 2009 H1N1 vaccine distribution, rural communities often only qualified for tens of doses instead of hundreds. The high minimum order dose has the potential to disadvantage rural health care clinicians and has the potential to waste vaccine due to the unusual cold chain storage. Even at 3 to 6 weeks away in vaccinating rural healthcare for workers should be avoided. In addition, . . . [audio issue] also being considered as a potential distribution method to overcome the cold chain challenges . . . [audio issue]. However, this creates questions about how long residents need to drive and hours of operation.

We already see these challenges in routine immunization work with communities further away from vaccinators having lower uptake in routine immunization.

SEPT,2020,"Elias Kass, ND ",Naturopathic Physician Seattle Washington ,"Hi. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. My name is Elias Kass. I’m a naturopathic physician practicing in Seattle Washington. I provide pediatric primary care and I’m a strong proponent of immunizations. So, as you can imagine, my job involves countering a lot of misinformation and clarifying the processes by which we have arrived at our vaccine schedule. I have long used the resources of the ACIP to illustrate to families that the process for evaluating and recommending vaccines is long, careful, and transparent. We use the recommendations that the ACIP published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) for each vaccine to show all the studies that are evaluated in deciding to recommend the vaccine—not just those mentioned in the package insert. We use those same recommendations to show that vaccines are tested, not just individually but against other vaccines typically given at a visit. We describe the incredible depth of experience of the sub-specialists working on the ACIP workgroups to show that these recommendations come from a place of tremendous knowledge and that the influencer on YouTube or Instagram or Facebook, no matter the degree, is not an equivalent source. Please continue to do this work—not only publishing openly, but prominently promoting the publication, especially around the COVID-19 vaccine. The public needs your assurance that your oversight continues to be free of political influence. A faltering or failing trust around this vaccine will have horrific repercussions on trust in our routine childhood and adult vaccines. We have long been able to point to ACIP doing the right thing—even when it reflects negatively on a vaccine like the RotaShield®, and even when it negatively affects the pharmaceutical industry like the withdrawal of the recommendation for FluMist® a few years ago. Please keep it up. Thank you so much for your work.

I’m a Pharmacist and Senior Director of the Center for Healthy Aging (CHA) at the National Council on Aging, or NCOA. I appreciate the opportunity to provide comments today on behalf of NCOA, older adults, caregivers, and the organizations that serve them. The NCOA is a respected national leader and trusted partner to help people age 60 plus meet their health and financial challenges. Vaccines are a vital part of healthy aging. Important priorities for NCOA are to ensure older adults have accurate vaccine information and access to vaccine using public benefits for which they are entitled. To begin, NCOA commends the committee’s diligent and rigorous work as America continues to face the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults represent 16% of COVID-19 cases, yet account for nearly 80% of the deaths. Complications of COVID-19 rise with age and other factors like chronic conditions that typically occur among older adults and increase the risk for hospitalization, poor health outcomes, and death. It’s also critical to mention the disproportional impact COVID-19 is having on communities of color who have always had to face health disparities such as higher rates of chronic conditions, income inequality, and inadequate access to quality healthcare. The older adults in these communities have historically fared even worse. While we navigate the pandemic and keep older adults up to date with existing vaccines for preventable diseases such as influenza and pneumonia, we believe there is a woeful lack of adequate representation of older adult advocates and experts on ACIP in its advisory components. We would like to see that change. Similar to the pediatric and OBGYN experts on the committee, we need a voice for older Americans—the medical experts who understand the unique health challenges such as the decline in immune function and response with age. We strongly believe these experts should be heard in ACIP’s discussions and decisions around all adult vaccine. In addition, we request that you explore establishing a working group solely focused on this critically vulnerable age group. This group would ensure that the committee continues to assess unique characteristics, living situations, and challenges that come with age and provide informed, expert counsel to the committee. Representatives should include diversity among perspectives of older adults who could be instrumental in advising ACIP in best practices for older adults in general, but also those with age-related risk factors and those who reside in congregate settings. The working group could also address vaccine distribution practices and the need to prioritize vaccination for older adults and their caregivers. Finally, the group could explore older adult perceptions and acceptance of vaccinations that are contributing to non-adherence and recommend targeted measures to improve vaccination rates. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments. We welcome further discussion and involvement as solutions are being developed.",0,1,0,5,Vaccines are a vital part of healthy aging. ,"older, preventable, prioritize, distribution",0,0,0,"In addition, we request that you explore establishing a working group solely focused on this critically vulnerable age group.","Older adults represent 16% of COVID-19 cases, yet account for nearly 80% of the deaths.",

Thank you for this opportunity to provide public comment. A huge thank you to the entire ACIP for the difficult work that you do to ensure that our vaccination recommendations are based on science and evidence, and that safe and effective vaccines continue to save lives and reduce morbidity across our country. Today, as we hear about this major effort to get out of the pandemic through the implementation of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, until then, we still need to get through the pandemic. That is, of course, all the important physical distancing and masking efforts, hand hygiene, et cetera and significantly restoring our routine immunization coverage rates in the country and improving our influenza immunizations this fall. We saw dramatic declines in the coverage rates for our routinely recommended vaccinations as a result of the pandemic. As of the end of August, claims data suggests that while those rates are beginning to recover, they are below pre- COVID-19 levels. In particular, recovering adolescent and adult immunization coverage rates are lacking recovery rates in the pediatric population and significantly, catch-up vaccination remains low. It is critical that as a nation we continue to identify and vaccinate all our population with their routinely recommended vaccines and catching up all who have missed doses of vaccine as a result of the pandemics. The IAC and Immunization Coalitions Network has developed a resource repository to assist all providers to improve their routine immunization efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is available from the IAC website at immunize.org. Getting through also requires that we continue to put effort in protecting our country against flu this fall. The overlapping high-risk conditions between influenza and COVID-19 make it critical that we protect against influenza and #avoidthetwindemic. Pandemics of influenza and COVID- 19 will create surge capacity issues for our health care systems. To improve flu vaccination rates, a strong unified national message to seek flu vaccination, even while under social distancing instructions, is necessary. Vaccination efforts must be accompanied by reassuring messaging that COVID-19 safety is being handled. Access points must be increased, varied, and innovative; the flu vaccination season must be extended beyond January; and provider payments must be commensurate with efforts in COVID-19 mitigation and costs of innovations. To assist with improving flu vaccinations, IAC has launched a mass immunization clinics resource repository and will be hosting a best practices webinar. For more details, visit the IAC website, again at immunize.org. Success with our flu fall vaccination efforts may indeed prepare us for our future COVID-19 work.

Thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of correctional workers and inmates. I enjoyed your presentations this morning. They were excellent and informative. Headlines September 10th Associated Press, “Virginia Jail on Lockdown After Nearly 70% of its Inmates Test Positive for Coronavirus.” There are 2 million inmates and another 750,000 correctional workers in correctional facilities every day. There are 125,000 inmates who have contracted coronavirus. That’s 6% of their population compared to 2% percent of the US population and 1,000 inmates have died. There is a disproportionate number of people of color and with chronic medical conditions incarcerated. Correctional workers must come in contact with these inmates, sometimes not under the best circumstances. The correctional workers go home to their families and neighbors. So what do we tell them to do? Wear masks? Sometimes they are very difficult to get because of supply. Practice social distancing. Right. In a jail and prison? Social distancing? There are big crowds. Many jails and prisons are overcrowded. Go outdoors. They’d love to go outdoors. Some of them might even go home. Wash your hands. Soap is difficult to get.

I’m here today on behalf of the National Consumers League (NCL). Since the league was founded in 1899, we have educated consumers about the vital role of vaccines in society and dispelled myths about vaccine safety. It is because of our history championship of vaccines that we present comments today on behalf of consumers who depend on these life-saving medical interventions. We extend our gratitude to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for all that you do to protect public health and for the opportunity to speak here today. NCL strongly urges ACIP to increase and enhance infrastructure regarding vaccine confidence as the nation navigates the COVID-19 pandemic. With over 6 million active cases and 200,000 lives lost, COVID-19 continues to spread at an alarming velocity. It is imperative that we harness our full reservoir of preventive services like vaccines. A small but vocal minority have politicized preventative health measures as perceived infringement of personal liberties. We need to ensure that vaccine hesitancy does not foil critical public health interventions, especially in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. We encourage ACIP to maintain effective public messaging and strong vaccine recommendations to ensure that the American public feels safe, informed, and empowered in their decisions to vaccinate once a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available. Due to COVID-19 and lockdowns, routine vaccinations across all age groups have declined by over 30% since 2019, with the largest decline observed among ages 19 to 49 at over 60%. Medically underserved communities and people with underlying health conditions are more vulnerable to adverse outcomes should they develop COVID-19. A decline in vaccination rates will further compromise herd immunity and endanger public health. Minority communities are among the hardest hit during this pandemic. Additionally, we request that clinical trials for the potential COVID-19 vaccine are inclusive and consists of diverse subjects. Minority communities face a unique set of challenges when deciding to vaccinate. Ensuring adequate representation in clinicaltrials would ensure vaccine confidence across all demographics. The vaccine must be safe, effective, and ample outreach must be done to curb vaccine hesitation regarding efficacy. In closing, to stem the tide of deaths from these vaccine-preventable diseases, NCL submits these comments for review by the committee to ensure that we fortify public health leaders with evidence-based medical interventions to help protect and advance the health of our nation during this pandemic.

I’d like to express appreciation from my organization and others representing high-risk populations for the continued work ASIP members have undertaken in the mist of the COVID-19 pandemic to help bring a vaccine to the public. However, many organizations representing older Americans feel there is more that we can do to assist you in your work. Just last week, more than a dozen organizations, including the National Hispanic Council on Aging, submitted a letter to Dr. Amanda Cohn expressing the concerns of the older advocate community regarding the ongoing need for better representation of our constituents at the ACIP table. While many of our organizations routinely weigh in on immunization matters concerning older Americans with ACIP and its members, we feel strongly that our voices need to be more routinely included in the policy and decision-making process that ACIP undertakes as it pertains to those 65 and older. Vaccine uptake and compliance are critical to the older adults our organization serves. We routinely encourage and remind our members about the need to be up to date on their immunizations. As has been pointed out today, that work is even more critical during the pandemic, with the coming flu season, and the increased risk associated with pneumococcal disease for older Americans. As pointed out in the letter to Dr. Cohn, we’re pleased with the work being done to increase development of vaccines targeting this older age group. However, we feel that makes our ask even more important. Our experts can provide critical guidance and knowledge in areas such as gerontology, geriatrics, and other science that impacts adults of advanced age. In addition to adding aging specialists to your membership, we also suggest that you consider establishing a working group focused upon this critical vulnerable age group. Such an action would make certain that there is continued examination of the unique characteristics and challenges that come with aging and provide information and council to your committee.

I’m the Executive Director of the California Immunization Coalition (CIC) and a Board Member of Vaccinate Your Family (VYF). The California Coalition is a statewide nonprofit dedicated to ensuring that Californians have access to life-saving vaccines. We work in partnership with our state and local health departments, community partners, and over a dozen local immunization coalitions that serve the unique needs of their California regions large and small. Within Vaccinate Your Family, we work nationally with healthcare advocates, partners, and statewide coalitions to educate the public about the importance of vaccinations to increase confidence and help shape positive vaccine policies. The pandemic has created an unprecedented challenge and a subsequent response. We believe that the general public has a much greater awareness of how diseases like COVID- 19 impact our entire world and how it particularly and devastatingly impacts individuals with certain chronic medical conditions. We hope this awareness will drive the development of new partnerships between public health and community organizations, patient advocacy groups, and specialized associations to increase awareness of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccinations and to reduce and eliminate health disparities. Thank you so much for the presentations that have informed us on the data and the tremendous work being accomplished so we are as prepared as possible for when the COVID-19 vaccine is ready. As we move forward, we want to especially emphasize the importance of building public confidence in this new vaccine by clearly communicating, that the decision-making process is unbiased, that recommendations are based on scientific evidence, that ACIP will not recommend a COVID-19 vaccine unless there is compelling evidence of safety and efficacy, and that there are strong systems in place in the United States to ensure ongoing vaccine safety. We ask for early and clear guidance to providers and mass vaccinators. Since there are going to be multiple vaccine products available, it is vital that we have really clear, understandable dosing and administration recommendations and materials and a consistent source of reliable information on transport and storage requirements for each vaccine. It is vital to establish realistic expectations when it comes to the phases, prioritization, supply, and efficacy. Finally, we strongly recommend incorporating the importance of continuing what we already know to be key practices in preventing COVID-19 spread. As the vaccines are being rolled out and beyond—continue to share that face coverings, hand washing, physical distancing, and vaccination are all part of a successful prevention strategy. We want to acknowledge and thank the members and staff of ACIP for your important work to keep our communities informed and safe during this challenging time.

FEB,2019,"Del Bigtree, CEO",Informed Consent Action Network ,"Hello. Thank you for this opportunity. My name is Del Bigtree. I am the CEO of the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN). Many of you received our 88 page review. We’ve been in a debate with Health and Human Services (HHS) discussing actual safety of vaccines, which is something I don’t hear happening in this room anywhere near enough. You cannot discuss safety without placebos. You’re not using placebos. Comparative control studies of vaccines that themselves have never been tested against placebo is a joke. We find ourselves in an autoimmune disease crisis and no one here seems to care about that. I want to talk about the fact that I’ve been here a year and a half. I’ve been watching you. I’ve watched discussions about things like Japanese Encephalitis (JE). Now correct me if I’m wrong, but nobody seems to be complaining about the fact that we have two vaccines that have injury rates—adverse events in over 100 people, 9 serious adverse events—when the disease itself has only infected 12 human beings in 24 years. That means both of these vaccines are 6 times more dangerous than the disease itself, yet no one on this panel seems to want to discuss that. I imagine you’re all going to pass whatever is next. This is the stupidest vaccine known to man. Remember, 12 people infected in America, 4 million people visiting Asia every single year, 24 years, 12 people have been infected and yet we’re having these conversations. It’s clear that this is a money making operation for the vaccine maker. It has nothing to do with actual safety. The next discussion would be—I could go into pregnancy and vaccines. You know, we have the warning that there is a 7-fold increase in giving the flu shot to pregnant women in the first trimester. We’ve actually challenged the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). I’ve sued and won lawsuits against the National Institutes of Health (NIH) now and HHS, and we’ve just settled with FDA because they’ve admitted they’ve never tested a flu shot or a Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis) vaccine on a single pregnant women in trials. Yet, you guys are assuming safety and giving it to pregnant women, and then overriding any signal you have from your own studies in the first trimester that it could be causing miscarriage. Then, to get around it, we just heard a study where they compared one vaccine to two vaccines as though that somehow gets to the bottom of the answer instead of how about we compare women that are getting vaccines during pregnancy to those that are getting none?  I could go on and on with these discussions, but the hepatitis B vaccine discussion, HEPLISAV- B®, you approved a vaccine at 100%. You asked great questions. You said, you know, “Has this brand new adjuvant that is going to start messing with toll-like receptors, has it ever been given with other adjuvanted vaccines? No, it never has. No data on that. But let it be known, we’re going to give them together at the same time and we’ll just assume that that will be safe.” Moving on, we know that there were 14 heart attacks during the trials. You brought it up here. You said in the discussion, “It’s an alarming signal, but we’ll see what happens.” That means Americans, our citizens, are now test groups—a part of a medical experiment you are putting on them. That is a direct violation of the Nuremburg Code. This is the state of settled science. You’re the only scientific body that is actually saying your science is settled in the entire world, and this is how you—I hope you will start being scientists and actually caring. Let’s have a placebo study. Let’s compare vaccinated to unvaccinated before we destroy our living control group.

FEB,2019,"Alvin Moss, MD ",Nephrologist ,"Dr. Romero, Dr. Cohn, members, and guests, I am a nephrologist. I work with the nephrologists who observed that dialysis-associated encephalopathy was caused by aluminum in the water used for dialysis. These patients developed a speech disorder and then they had personality changes. With repeated exposures to aluminum on dialysis, they got progressively worse and died. At autopsy, they had very high concentration of aluminum in their brains. When the aluminum was removed from the dialysis, the syndrome disappeared. Second, in pre-term infants, pediatricians noted that intravenous feeding with aluminum-containing solutions led to long-term neurologic impairment. Like for dialysis patients, the aluminum neurotoxicity was cumulative and dose-related, with the toxic effect or the neurotoxicity being seen when the infants had received 450 micrograms or more of aluminum. Third, in a case report in a series of 159 autistic patients, neurologists at Hopkins described a 19-month old healthy little girl who, within 48 hours of receiving DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b), MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), polio, and varicella containing a total of 850 micrograms of aluminum experienced fever, inconsolable crying, and refusal to walk, which progressed to autism. In her work-up, the neurologists found mitochondrial dysfunction. In their series of 159 patients, they found findings suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction in 47% of the autistic patients. Others have observed a similar rate of mitochondrial dysfunction in autistic patients. The neurologists hypothesized that the oxidative stresses of immune activation with vaccination compromised brain cellular energy metabolism in patients with mitochondrial dysfunction leading to regressive autism. In post mortem studies of autistic patients, researchers have found concentrations of aluminum in their brains as high as those in patients with dialysis-associated encephalopathy. Why am I telling you this? Well, first of all, we now understand aluminum neurotoxicity. It occurs in a susceptible population after repeated exposures with a cumulative toxic dose. It is eradicated when the aluminum is removed. So, the vaccine schedule. Of the 26 vaccines that are administered by 18 months in the CDC vaccine schedule, 61% contain aluminum for a total of 4925 micrograms of aluminum. Children receive an aluminum-containing vaccine on every single visit until 18 months of age. In sum, cumulative aluminum causes brain damage in some children. Please consider what you’re doing with aluminum in vaccines. Thank you very much. ",1,0,0,2,"In sum, cumulative aluminum causes brain damage in some children.

FEB,2019,"Alison Singer, Co-Founder ",Autism Science Foundation ,"Good afternoon. I am Alison Singer. I am the Co-Founder and President of the Autism Science Foundation (ASF). I’m also the mother of a daughter diagnosed with severe autism, and I serve as legal guardian for my older brother who is also diagnosed with severe autism. The Autism Science Foundation’s mission is to support research to uncover the causes of autism, and to develop evidence-based treatments for people with autism. Toward that end over the past few years, scientific studies have shown that genetic abnormalities and structural brain changes are apparent in children with autism as early as the second trimester prenatally. We are also developing diagnostic biomarkers that enable reliable diagnosis at 6 months and as early as 6 weeks in a lab environment, which is well before behavioral symptoms even emerge. As we all know, back in the 90s there was concern that autism might be caused by vaccines. At that time, I shared that concern but dozens of research studies have indicated that this is not the case and that vaccines do not cause autism. Fortunately, the vast majority of our families have been convinced by weight of this evidence and have vaccinated their children. However, there is still a handful of families who have a child with autism who choose to withhold lifesaving vaccines from their younger children. Studies confirm that the younger siblings of children with autism are among the lowest vaccinated in the country. As a member of the federal Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC), I can appreciate the substantial amount of work that the ACIP and working group members conduct in preparation for the votes on each of your vaccine recommendations. It is reassuring to us to know that the committee uses the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach and the Evidence to Recommendations (EtR) framework. However, with the recent increased public interest in this committee’s deliberations due in part to the ongoing outbreaks of measles, influenza, and whooping cough nationwide, the Autism Science Foundation asks that the committee spend time during the next scheduled meeting, and perhaps on an annual basis, explaining the process used to make its recommendations, including a clear description of the type of vaccine safety data requested prior to making any new or revised recommendations. A description of the type of safety data reviewed for each vaccine should be prominently placed on the ACIP website. This type of transparency would go a long way toward boosting public confidence in your deliberative process, and would also be very valuable to advocacy organizations seeking to provide resources to vaccine-hesitant families. The National Academy of Sciences has also conducted several studies over the past decade which affirm the safety of the Childhood Immunization Schedule. This month, the Academy has taken the important step of developing a web page to further clarify its position that vaccines are extremely safe and have few side effects. I would urge the committee to link to this declaration via the ACIP Home Page as well. Thank you for your work, and thank you for helping us to provide important and useful resources for our families so that we can encourage them to keep their children safe by vaccinating them.",0,1,0,4,"This month, the Academy has taken the important step of developing a web page to further clarify its position that vaccines are extremely safe and have few side effects.

FEB,2019,"Lori Boyle, RN, APN ",Nurses Who Vaccinate ,"My name is Lori. I’m the mother of two fully vaccinated successful young adults, and I’m a Registered Nurse (RN) of 22 years. The last 5 of those have been as an Advanced Practice Nurse (APN). I’m here today representing the organization, Nurse Who Vaccinate (NWV). We are a grassroots organization that works to provide up-to-date, accurate information to the public and to our fellow healthcare workers regarding vaccination. I received a very strong foundation in evidence-based practice at Rutgers University that has stayed with me to this day. Unfortunately, around the same time I also became aware of misinformation regarding vaccination. It was very disheartening for me to see so many people, including nurses, fall prey to sensationalist headlines and misinformation while I was learning how to research and evaluate peer-reviewed literature. I discovered NWV while in grad school and through them, I found a way to share those critical thinking skills that I was acquiring and share them with other nursing professionals. My first job as an APN was with the largest infectious disease practice in the Northeast. While in that practice, the need for sharing legitimate information on vaccines was only reinforced. I saw young otherwise healthy college students in the intensive care unit (ICU) with flu. I saw countless people with pneumococcal disease. I saw people at risk of losing limbs due to meningococcal disease. Imagine my disbelief when after caring for those people, I then encountered nurses who refused the flu shot, or advised others against vaccinating based on misinformation. This is per your recommendations, all based on no placebo-controlled scientific data on the vaccine ingredients, the synergistic interactions between all components separate or in combination for 30 years. Here is the HHS response to the lawsuit filed by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in 2017 where they admit to that. This is scientific fraud. Your job is to protect public health and not pharmaceutical companies’ wealth who have zero liability for their impure products because of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) established in 1986. Since vaccination does not equal immunization due to primary and secondary vaccine failure, the only immunity in existence is the immunity for the vaccine manufacturers from lawsuits. The science isn’t settled. It is being censored. With your recommendations to add further inadequately tested vaccine such as the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine and Gardasil® for travelers like me, you are playing Russian Roulette with my health and that of my family. No healthcare pays for my injuries. Instead, I am being bullied, berated, and denied my constitutional and religious freedoms. Autoimmune diseases; cancers; allergies; autism; neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Lyme, et cetera driven by the contaminants and excipients of these inadequately tested vaccines are causing this epidemic of chronic disease in the US. Yet, the 2000 serious vaccine injuries reported to VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) are being ignored and dismissed while the few dozen people with measles are being considered a state of emergency. Until the federal law is obeyed and the safety and efficacy studies are done on the whole CDC schedule, you should not add a single vaccine to the schedule. To do anything else is ethically unacceptable.

FEB,2019,Marcy Flickinger ,Concerned Citizen ,"Good afternoon. My name is Marcy Flickinger. I come here from Pennsylvania. I’m a concerned citizen and mother to three children. I know that there is a lot of emotion here today: anger, hope, disbelief, and lots of concern. I’m not here to talk about the emotional aspects of vaccine injury. I’m here to talk about the science. There is a growing body of evidence which has raised legitimate concerns about the following facts: 1) According to both the CDC and FDA websites, there are no clinically approved adjuvants—only clinically approved vaccines as a whole. So, what that means is the whole is considered safe, yet the individual components have never been deemed safe; 2) According to the Gardasil®9 pre-market trials, aluminum was used as a placebo. A placebo is defined as “an inert substance.” I know and you know that aluminum is not an inert substance and yet, it is being used as a placebo. Using aluminum as a placebo control group is unethical and obscures the outcome to the safety profile for this vaccine; 3) According to Dr. Plotkin’s testimony in a family court case dated January 2018 when asked the following question, “In order to establish whether it is causal between the vaccine and the condition, you need a randomized placebo controlled study,” under oath Plotkin replied, “yes.” When asked, “But that was not done before hepatitis B vaccine licensure was it?” under oath Dr. Plotkin replied, “No.” Let me state here as of today, there has not been one true inert placebo controlled study of any of the vaccines on the current CDC schedule. The IOM (Institute of Medicine) states that there are 135 adverse reactions that cannot be determined, causal or not. Just a few of these include encephalitis, seizures, meningitis, transverse myelitis. I understand and agree that correlation doesn’t equal causation, but inadequate data to determine causation does not negate the adverse reaction either. According to the National Academies Press (NAP), and I quote, “The committee encountered many gaps in limitations and knowledge bearing directly and indirectly on the safety of vaccines. They include inadequate understanding or inconsistent information from case reports and case series.” They go on to say, “If research capacity and accomplishments in these areas are not improved, future reviews of vaccine safety will be similarly handicapped.” These details are too important to ignore when our children’s health is at risk. I’ll end with this. This has happened time and time again in human history. Science is not static. Romans had lead pipes. Asbestos was used in schools. Tobacco was considered healthy. Cocaine was used in medicine. Over and over again, we have unknowingly harmed our communities. It has taken strong advocates and a lot of strong science to overcome these norms. We have learned and we have evolved. We have righted our wrongs in the past despite the tension that exists between the profits that drive the industry and the science that could impact that profit. How much longer are you going to turn a blind eye? The fact that vaccine mandates are being considered before you do your challenging job of insuring vaccine safety is nothing short of reckless.

FEB,2019,Jackie Martin-Sebell ,Concerned Citizen ,"Hello. I am a mother to three immunocompromised children. As a parent of three medically complex kids, I am bombarded with the notion that I and my family and friends must vaccinate ourselves to protect our sick children. We are persuaded to ask our friends and community members to disregard the very real list of harm from vaccines to protect our kids. Parents of children who are immunocompromised and the medical professionals who work with them must acknowledge that any illness can be a cause of harm and should take precautions as such. The common cold or strep throat can be as dangerous to my child as measles or mumps could. We should not be relying on vaccines to keep them safe, especially given that vaccines protect against very few diseases. There are thousands of other diseases equally or more dangerous, yet the only ones we fear are those that there are vaccines for. A recently vaccinated person is a far bigger threat to my child than a non-vaccinated healthy person is. Why isn’t it protocol for doctors to warn parents that their children are contagious during the respective shedding period for each live virus vaccine? Failure to warn the public of this puts kids like mine at risk. There are viruses and bacteria everywhere. Parents need to do what they can to minimize them for their child without expecting others to put their own child in harm’s way for a fake sense of security. My kids are immunocompromised in part because of vaccines. I would never want someone to put their child at risk for the fear of my child getting sick. On that end, we are told that our children are too sick to get vaccinated and so our friends and family must. Yet on the opposite end, we are at times persuaded to get our own immunocompromised child vaccinated because they are at such high risk for the disease. Some medical professionals push in us the need to get our sick kids vaccinated even though vaccines can and often do cause more harm than the illness itself would. My children were vaccinated for several years. My older son suffered documented illness and regression following vaccination. He has known anaphylactic allergies to ingredients in vaccinations, yet I still get told by some medical professionals overseeing his care that I should vaccinate him because he is at greater risk for a disease. It’s doublespeak all for the purpose of scaring parents like myself into vaccinating our already vulnerable children. Parents of children who are immunocompromised are incredibly scared. Part of that is because of the fearmongering from those that they trust, including home care nurses, therapists, medical doctors, insurance companies, and government agencies. This program is supposed to be about protecting children and vulnerable populations. These vaccines are not safe for everyone and the universal one-size-fits-all policy should be eliminated. Doctors should be encouraged to take full medical histories and know all vaccine reactions in order to slow down schedules for some kids and skip some shots for others. There shouldn’t be blanket rules for writing medical exemptions. Every child is unique and decisions need to be made based on individual risk as perceived by parents in cooperation with their children’s doctors. The fear tactics have really been working, but we need to base decisions on facts and not fear.

FEB,2019,"Patricia Neuenschwander, PNP ",Pediatric Nurse Practitioner ,"Good afternoon. My name is Patricia Neuenschwander. I’m a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (PNP) and I’ve been a nurse for 25 years. I come to you today because as a healthcare practitioner, it is challenging for me to agree to something that hasn’t undergone a certain level of rigorous study. None of the vaccines on the current recommended schedule have undergone large, inert, placebo-controlled trials, including Gardasil®9, which is one of the things you’re considering recommending in adults aged 26 to 45. The GRADE study, as mentioned earlier, is one of the strongest evidence used to review and make a recommendation. So, if I may briefly remind this committee what was presented in October by Dr. Meites, the GRADE study evaluated 16 studies of Gardasil®2 and Gardasil®4 in adults aged 26 to 45. None of the studies were on Gardasil®9. Not a single safety or efficacy study was presented using Gardasil®9 in this age group. Out of those 16 studies, 7 were randomized clinical control trials, which were all downgraded because they didn’t use Gardasil®9. Of the 7, 6 used aluminum as an adjuvant, a known neurotoxin, as placebo. By the way, one study, Wilkins, did use 50 HIV-infected women who received a saline placebo because the manufacturer, Merck, didn’t have placebo available. By combining the placebo group so that no real comparisons could be made between the 50 that received saline and the 176 that received aluminum and compare that to the 226 that received Gardasil®4 in this study, nearly 10% of participants in both groups experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) and the study was stopped early due to futility. It simply didn’t work. The evidence presented is not acceptable to me, and it would not be acceptable to other healthcare providers if they were aware of what you are using. I am asking that you require at least one large safety study with Gardasil®9 using a saline control, a harmless substance, before making any recommendation. By using evidence from one vaccine to recommend another, you are bearing false witness. This historical practice of approving and recommending vaccines without adequate safety needs to end now. It is not unethical to do this study. I believe it is unethical to recommend this vaccine without it. Please don’t turn a blind eye. You are scientists. You are doctors. You know deep down that it is wrong to recommend something like this without rigorous analysis. You owe the American people a gold standard study before unleashing this on potentially 100 million people. Merck stands to make billions of liability-free dollars from this recommendation. Please require that they substantiate safety and efficacy first. In closing, if this committee chooses to recommend this vaccine without adequate safety studies, will you, the liaison representatives that you’re here representing, will you tell them that this recommendation came without one safety study or efficacy study? Because we will. We will scream this horrifying truth from the rooftops. Please do your job and protect public health. Increase confidence in the schedule by requiring evidence-based science in your recommendations.

I’m a traveling Registered Nurse and I have worked in over 20 hospitals in the last 10 years across the United States from Florida to Colorado and back again. The things I have seen regarding vaccines is something most people would not believe. There is an increase in flu vaccine mandates in many career fields, especially hospitals, in order to keep our jobs. Yet there is currently no law or reason to be vaccinated with a flu shot. Some of these people who received the flu vaccine begin getting symptoms, including tingling or prickling sensations in their fingers and toes; muscle weakness in their legs that travels to their upper body and gets worse over time; difficulty walking steadily; difficulty moving their eyes or face, talking, chewing swallowing; and severe lower back pain. The majority of the time, these patients go to the ER (emergency room) and are sent home with a new prescription to Gabapentin® or Lyrica®. Sometimes they are considered a stroke alert until ruled out and sent home with no formal diagnosis. It is not until they break a foot, a leg, or a hip because they keep falling down that they are admitted to the hospital and further testing is done. Some people who have these symptoms are told it’s from the flu shot. However, others are never told the flu shot could have caused their symptoms. Many are never aware they’re entitled to apply for monetary compensation through the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program if they receive the injuries from the flu shot or any vaccine. It’s upsetting to see patients who are adults who have families they need to provide for who can’t work anymore, who don’t have the answers, and who don’t know they’re entitled to compensation. How are they going to take care of their families now? They’re regular working and functioning adults like you and me who are now handicapped and never get properly diagnosed or receive help for themselves and their families. Most doctors are not medically trained to look for vaccine injuries and, therefore, many vaccine injuries go undiagnosed. When these patients come into my care, they tell me they have been ruled out of everything and the doctors don’t know what’s wrong with them. This is completely unacceptable, given that they have textbook symptoms of an illness status post- influenza vaccine, especially when no double-blind safety studies have ever been done on vaccines with a saline placebo in the last 30 years. More studies must be done and mandates should be suspended until we know for sure.

FEB,2019,Nicole Mason ,Concerned Citizen ,"Thank you. Before I begin I just want to ask that my microphone not be lowered in any type of volume because I want to be heard loud and I want to be heard clear. I come from a family with a medical background. If you would have ever asked me before August 2018 if you should vaccinate your child, I would have said, “Of course you should vaccinate your child. You would have been crazy not to.” Then my son was injured. August 2018 I received a phone call from my husband telling me that he was rushing our 4-month old son to the nearest pediatric hospital. He was defecating blood, profusely vomiting, and very lethargic. The ER doctor asked how long my son’s symptoms had been going on and if he was up-to-date on his vaccinations. My husband said his symptoms were 12 hours in and he received his 4-month vaccines just 4 days earlier. My son was diagnosed with intussusception after confirmation with an X-ray. I remember a 14 gauge needle taped to the CT scanner in case my son’s intestines exploded during the scan. The lead pediatric doctor came into talk to us and I asked her what could possibly have caused this. Her answer, “It just happens, you know, to some kids for no reason. We don’t really know why.” This would be a common phrase that I would hear from every medical professional that we encountered from the ER nurse, to the ER doctor, to the Residents, to the head Gastroenterologist at the leading pediatric children’s hospital in our city and my son’s own pediatrician. The only talk of vaccines was at a follow-up visit with our pediatrician who said that he would not give him the vaccine again even though he didn’t believe it injured him. Correlation does not equal causation, right? About 48 hours after all this went down, I received a phone call from a CRAZY Mothers® friend of mine who I’d written off a long time ago. She wanted to let me know that if my son had been recently vaccinated with a rotavirus vaccine that I needed to read the insert because there was the answer right on that insert—intussusception. I can accept the fact that adverse reactions can happen, but then I started to question what those adverse reactions actually were and I started weighing the risk of the disease I was protecting him against from the risk of the vaccine reactions. That was my “light bulb” moment. Something is wrong. Something is very wrong. How is the vaccine that caused my son’s intestine to fold in on itself and almost die safe and effective? My husband and I agreed that we would only research medical scientific data going forward on vaccinations. I was under the assumption that all of these people just write a blog. After pouring through peer-reviewed science, vaccine inserts, the CDC, and the NIH (National Institutes of Health) website, I discovered there is no sufficient science proving vaccine safety. The first shocking thing we learned is that there is no double-blind placebo study for any of these vaccinations we give our children. Vaccines are studied against other vaccines. How is that safe and how is that ethical? I started to research the vaccine inserts to find that not only is intussusception listed as a possible reaction, but that sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is listed. I was under the assumption that this just happens for no reason. Encephalopathy was listed as an adverse reaction. How is my infant supposed to tell me that his brain is swelling? Or is it just written off as colic and reflux? I don’t know. So that’s when I knew I wasn’t being fully informed. I don’t have time to go over all of the other adverse reactions, but I came here to tell you we’re paying attention now.",1,0,0,2,"I can accept the fact that adverse reactions can happen, but then I started to question what those adverse reactions actually were and I started weighing the risk of the disease I was protecting him against from the risk of the vaccine reactions","child, safety, SIDS, reaction",0,0,0,0,The first shocking thing we learned is that there is no double-blind placebo study for any of these vaccinations we give our children. ,
FEB,2019,Tiendra (Tia) Severino ,Concerned Parent ,"Hi. Tia Severino. Luke’s mom. The term “scientific fraud” describes “intentional misrepresentation of the methods, procedures, or results of scientific research. Scientific fraud includes fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing scientific research or in reporting research results.” The public representation of vaccine science as conclusive proof that vaccines do not cause autism is deceptive and fraudulent at its core. Science is never settled. In June 2000, CDC held a secret meeting called “Scientific Review of the Vaccine Safety Datalink” at the Simpsonwood Conference Center to discuss the problems with the Verstraeten study looking at thimerosal in vaccines. The transcripts were leaked, showing the very intimate relationship between the CDC and pharma. At this meeting they determined that there was, “no way to massage the data to get the signal to go away.” Conveniently, the original study data disappeared. In 2003, Verstraeten produced another study using children too young to receive a diagnosis. In June 2004, CDC published, “Age at first measles-mumps-rubella vaccination in children with autism and school-matched control subjects: a population-based study in metropolitan Atlanta” comparing on-time versus late administration of MMR. There was no comparison to children who did not receive the vaccine. The findings from this study were so troubling that a decision was made to omit all together the data showing the signal. This was used to dismiss nearly 5000 cases known as the “Autism Omnibus Proceedings” in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. According to Dr. William Thompson, this study was the lowest point in his career to date. He has massive guilt when he encounters families with autism. He knows he was part of the problem. In 2014, Thompson said, “The CDC has put the research 10 years behind.” Now we’re 15 years behind because the CDC is paralyzed by anything to do with autism. Criminal acts of scientific fraud have gone unpunished while scientists who dare to question vaccines are routinely hounded and their careers destroyed. We are constantly told that hundreds of studies debunk the link and none prove it. Actually, only one ingredient and one vaccine have been studied and the link was covered up. Meanwhile, the list of studies that support causation continues to grow—studies this body ignores. When you all say, “The science is settled. Vaccines don’t cause autism,” you are bearing false witness to the public—a violation of the 9th commandment. It is time to stop the lying.",1,0,0,2,The public representation of vaccine science as conclusive proof that vaccines do not cause autism is deceptive and fraudulent at its core. ,"autism, fraud, causation",0,0,0,0,"The transcripts were leaked, showing the very intimate relationship between the CDC and pharma.

FEB,2019,Rilei Cherry ,Concerned Citizen ,"Good afternoon. My name is Rilei Cherry. I reside in Jacksonville, Florida. I’m a Navy wife of eight and a half years. Together we have three boys and are expecting our fourth son. I’m here today with something to share. My first son was born in 2011 and by 18 months he knew all of his colors, shapes, numbers to 20, animals and their sounds, upper and lower case letters, and he was reading sight words. We’re talking about an 18-month old baby. He never cried. He was always smiling. Overseas screening required MMR vaccination to go to Japan, a vaccine that I had delayed for controversial information. Day 1, he wouldn’t wake up. I called the nurse. She said it was normal. Day 2, diarrhea, vomiting, cranky, and refused all nourishment. A second call placed and was told it was normal. Woke up on Day 3 to him beating his head into his crib. He acted like he didn’t even know us and forgot everything. I was convinced that it was a coincidence. My son was diagnosed with autism. 2013, my second son was born. 24 hours after his 2-month vaccines, he was rush to the ER because I found him blue and barely breathing. When they took him out of my arms and rushed him back without us, I didn’t know what to think. I was just scared. Sometime later, white coats came out and I thought they were going to tell me that he was gone. Thankfully, they did not. He’s 5 years old today. Again, I was told it was rare and that I was doing the best thing for him. 2017, my baby boy who is going to be 2 tomorrow, my third son. I was more skeptical of vaccines and I spaced out his 2-month vaccines, and at 10 months old, my son was laying under the ceiling fan and he was hand flapping doing this (gesture). He did not play. He did not coo. He did not smile. He did not track. He did not meet any of his milestones. My 10-month old was 6 months behind at the time. I started using natural products and detoxed my son, and he caught up developmentally and has little residual damage. My oldest son has far more long-term damage than his brothers. We owe it to our children to truly look at the long-term effects of vaccines and be honest about what could happen to our children. Thank you.",1,0,0,1,"I was more skeptical of vaccines and I spaced out his 2-month vaccines, and at 10 months old, my son was laying under the ceiling fan and he was hand flapping doing this (gesture).

FEB,2019,"Erin Marie Olszewski, Founder ",Nurses for Vaccine Safety Alliance ,"Good afternoon. My name is Erin Olszewski. I’m a Registered Nurse, RN/BSN. I’m also the Founder of Nurse for Vaccine Safety Alliance. I do agree that nurses are the most trusted profession, and this is exactly why we need to advocate for our patients’ safety. That is our job. In addition, I am also a United States Army combat-injured Veteran. When I enlisted to serve my country, I swore by oath that I would support and “defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” I have every intension of keeping that promise to my country. So, when you force a child to take 70 plus vaccines full of aluminum, formaldehyde, antifreeze, cancer-causing retroviruses, aborted fetal cells to name just a few and your government mandates this, we have a domestic situation going on. So, I am aware that many of you are not even listening to me. I’m also aware that most of the pharmaceutical company reps sitting behind me right now, they’re not listening either. The same goes for the politicians, and the lobbyist, and even the government officials that can’t even seem to govern themselves right now. So, we are being censored here in order to preserve the remaining corruption waiting to be uncovered and we will. But it’s okay because it’s not any of you who gets to dictate or decide what we do, and we will continue to expose your corruption day by day. We promise this. So, today my speech is not meant for you. I’m speaking to the people on the answers to their questions. I’m speaking to the American troops that are being experimented on right now. I’m speaking to the people out there who are demanding medical freedom, who are fighting for their rights to choose what goes into their body and rightfully deserve the sovereignty over their own life and the lives of their own children. So, this is why we the people will win this domestic war of assault, tyranny, and the stripping away of our freedom fought for with the bloodshed of our own American heroes. So, I’m speaking to all of the people out there listening and I’m telling them let’s rise up and take action, because we will not be silent. We will not allow you guys to control us anymore. So, I’ll close with this quote by Thomas Jefferson in a letter to Colonel William S. Smith in 1787, “What country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.” So, we refuse to let history repeat itself. So, as a wife, as a mother, as a nurse, and as a defender of freedom, I say this: Where there is risk, there will be a choice. So, we have solved the riddles of your lies, corruption, and collusion. And you know what? You know that we know.

FEB,2019,Mary Pulles Cavanaugh ,Concerned Citizen ,"Good afternoon to the members of Immunization Practices and invited guests. Thank you for this opportunity today. My name is Mary Pulles Cavanaugh. I’m an autism mom, independent researcher, and a co-author of a Thinking Moms’ Revolution (TMR) book called, “Evolution of a Revolution: Autism and the Path from Hope to Healing.” I’m also the author, “The Book On Greatness: How to Keep Shining Your Light.” I would like to believe the committee I am standing before today are acting on good faith when they are presented with information pertaining to the safety of vaccines and vote accordingly. It is my hope that you listen and retain all of the information you hear today and apply it to your voting decisions. Vaccines can inflame our brains, delete our DNA, cause microflora dysfunction, lower our immune system, reduce oxygen and blood flow, lower our frequency, and compromise our primary reflexes which relate to the functioning of the left and right sides of our body and brain. I will talk about two personal vaccine injury cases. Case number one, a 22-year old girl vaccine- injured at age 2 by the DTaP and Hib vaccines was given the diagnosis PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified) in 2007 at the age of 11 after being misdiagnosed with ADHD in second grade. PDD-NOS has recently been removed as a diagnostic code. Removing a diagnostic code does not erase the health condition that looks like the following: difficulty making decisions, impulse, slow to react, slow to complete school work and homework, difficulty following classmates’ conversations, missing social cues, and worst of all, no friends. This one lady does not have the cognition needed to study in an academic college, never mind her very understandably eroded confidence in herself. She struggles with driving because of the processing it requires. She has perfect pitch and attends a higher learning art school on a musical theater scholarship. Frequently, she cannot ride the train to school because of severe chronic anxiety. But worst of all, at times she is depressed and suicidal. If her mother would get the news that she killed herself today, this would come as no surprise. This young adult I’ve just described is one of many. Many choose an acting career because in that setting, they can escape the pain of being themselves. She was permanently injured by vaccines she received at age 2. In 2015, the CDC reported an estimated 4% of the general population had thoughts of suicide. However, in adults with high functioning autism, the number jumped to 66% reporting suicidal ideation. Case number two, a father/grandfather in his 70s developed cerebella ataxia very slowly after yearly flu shots. The Department of Justice (DOJ) cites this as one of the flu shot table injuries. The flu vaccine contains 25,000 times more mercury than is legally allowed in water. Our blood is 95% water. Our brain and body is made of 75% water. This mercury assault can be very problematic in these conditions. He was permanently injured in his golden years. Why am I speaking to you today? The time has come for a new paradigm. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. The body needs to have the ability to recognize and process everything that enters it. In many vaccine injury cases, this is not occurring. We must come to the realization that nobody is created the same and medical treatment should support that individuality. If this committee were more trustworthy with recognizing vaccine injuries, the public might trust your recommendations more. You have a lot of work to do to regain the public’s trust. I leave you with a bible verse from a doctor, Luke 16:10, “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.” Thank you.",1,0,0,1,"Vaccines can inflame our brains, delete our DNA, cause microflora dysfunction, lower our immune system, reduce oxygen and blood flow, lower our frequency, and compromise our primary reflexes which relate to the functioning of the left and right sides of our body and brain.","flu, autism, injuries, bible",0,0,0,We must come to the realization that nobody is created the same and medical treatment should support that individuality,"However, in adults with high functioning autism, the number jumped to 66% reporting suicidal ideation.

FEB,2019,Melissa Chios ,Concerned Citizen ,"My name is Melissa Chios. I traveled from New York to speak before you today because I am passionate about children’s health. I’d like to add that your recommendations do not apply to my family as we abstain from vaccination since the practice conflicts with my religious beliefs, so I speak to advocate for other children. It is perplexing that this generation of US children is riddled with chronic illness unlike any before. Considering the exorbitant and unprecedented cost we incur for their healthcare, clearly the reward for our investment in their health falls far short of our expectations. Today’s new normal is a generation of children with an incredibly high prevalence of asthma, anaphylactic allergies, skin disorders, seizure disorders, diabetes, learning disabilities, neurodevelopmental disorders, cancer. This is especially concerning since the alarming rates in children’s chronic illness is clearly coterminous with the rapidly increasing CDC recommended vaccine schedule. That being said, how can it be responsible to add any additional vaccines to the already over- inflated schedule in the absence of double-blind, inert placebo safety studies of these vaccines—nonetheless, the entire CDC recommended schedule of 72 doses of 16 vaccines? Moreover, it is apparent that this advisory committee is completely disregarding legitimate studies being conducted around the world specifically with regard to aluminum. The work of Dr. Christopher Exley of England, Dr. Christopher Shaw of British Columbia, Dr. Yehuda Shoenfeld of Israel, Dr. Romain Gherardi of France, and Dr. Zhibin Yao of China have all brought to light unsettling safety concerns regarding the use of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines. These studies have been brought to your attention and met only with your silence. I would like to speak for the record that I am providing you copies of the many studies I referenced for your review. Another disconcerting fact is that for years, the CDC has been ordered by Congress to conduct a vax versus un-vax study and yet to date, it has neglected to do so. Meanwhile, independent studies such as the 2017 Mawson homeschool study have compared the outcomes of vaccine- free children to those of fully vaccinated children, revealing that the vaccine-free children have significantly lower prevalence of allergic rhinitis, allergies, ADHD, ASD, eczema, learning disabilities, neurodevelopmental disorders, and other chronic conditions. These findings should compel you to require further research, and it is unconscionable to add any additional vaccines until the proper studies have been conducted. There has also been a history of blatant corruptions, malfeasance and complex entitlements between the governmental agencies and the industries from which they are tasked to protect us, and we are watching your actions vigilantly. I would like to conclude by saying that we who stand before you today put you on notice that we have every intention of holding each and every one of you on this committee accountable for your actions, for dismissing legitimate concerns by respected scientific researchers, and for your pernicious silence. Thank you.",1,0,0,1,"I’d like to add that your recommendations do not apply to my family as we abstain from vaccination since the practice conflicts with my religious beliefs, so I speak to advocate for other children.

FEB,2019,Gina Garrett-Harrison ,Concerned Citizen ,"I’m Gina Harrison. My son is medically exempt from all vaccines because of the damage of your recommendations. We hear vaccines are being made safer for the future, but what does that say about the vaccines that you’ve recommended? If vaccines today are safer than the vaccines of yesteryear, then what does that say about the vaccines that we received as kids? They’ve never been safe. It’s no secret vaccines have never been proven safe, they’ve never been proven effective, and they’ve never been proven to eradicate one disease. MMR package insert page 1 says that, “The impact of the MMR vaccine can be measured by comparing the number of cases before and after the vaccine.” So, what you’re saying is correlation does equal causation. But we do know one truth about the theory of vaccination and that is by design, it intentionally creates permanent changes to our immune system. That’s where your science of vaccination stops and you’re rolling the dice after that. Ironically, the epidemic of autoimmune diseases has exploded. The more vaccines you recommend, the more collateral damage we see and you say that there is no connection. You’re also recommending vaccinations during pregnancy and day one of life when there is no public health threat so great someone would need to inject known toxins with known risk during an infant’s most critical time of development and with zero proof backing your claims. So, if you’re truly interested in controlling epidemics, start doing proper double-blind vaccine studies using a true inert saline placebo. Our children deserve gold standard testing and you need to make safety a priority over profits. Stanly Plotkin’s deposition page 165 and he states, “If you’re looking for a phenomenon occurring in the vaccine group, you cannot judge that phenomenon without having a control group” and you’ve blindly added every vaccine to the schedule using junk science. You’ve not only failed the public’s safety, but you’ve also failed at controlling simple measles rashes within communities whose vaccination rate is 100%, and that destroys your herd immunity theory. So, if you cannot fully guarantee the safety of your products that you’re forcing on the public, you have no right experimenting with our lives. Until the numerous lawsuits surrounding the safety of fraud surrounding the safety have been fully addressed and this CDC is compliant with law, the entire schedule needs to be halted and the power of adding vaccines to the schedule should never be left in the hands that profit from them. Self-investigation and fraudulent studies should never be allowed, and stop hiding behind the 1986 Act that protects any vaccine maker from being sued. Lastly, you need to stop BS-ing the public and let the dangers be known, because we’re not going away.

FEB,2019,Elizabeth (Liza) Coutu ,Concerned Citizen ,"My name is Liza Coutu. I’m from North Carolina. I’m a wife of over 25 years, a mom of 7 children, and a follower of Christ. Protecting religious rights when it comes to what is injected into myself and my family is of extremely high priority. Many states are setting bills in motion to strip those rights from us. This is due in part to misinformation provided to them about the value of vaccination over other methods of being healthy. It is also stemming from a misguided belief that vaccines are the best way to protect the public, and that those who hold religious beliefs regarding vaccination are standing in the way of that protection of the public. We simply cannot know for sure if the vaccines are the best way to protect the public if we continue to refuse to study the overall health of the vaccinated versus the completely non-vaccinated. In my own family for example, my healthiest child is my youngest who never received any vaccines. All 6 of her older siblings had at least one vaccine each. All of her older siblings have at least one chronic condition such as allergies and eczema. Hundreds of other families have told me the same thing. They stopped vaccinating their children and their younger children are healthier than their older. Is this true for most families that have stopped vaccinating or who never started? I suspect so, but we can only know for sure if the studies are done to compare vaccinated to fully non-vaccinated using the information found in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). Regardless, God has placed my children in my care and I need to be able to make the decisions for that care, including what medical treatments they receive. I’m sure that you believe that what you are doing is right for protecting people, but there needs to be more caution. The recommendations you make here are immediately added to the schedule and ought to be made with excellent data. I watched as you voted unanimously to add a vaccine recommendation for hepatitis A with very poor data as your source. Even when there is evidence that the vaccine is harming some, it is still approved as with the hepatitis B vaccine and its issues with myocardial infarctions (MI). Seeing decisions like that only serves to reinforce my mistrust of your care about the citizens of the United States. It reinforces my resolve to protect my family as I believe God wants me to. I’m here to let you know that I’m watching what you’re doing and I will speak up about what I see. Thank you.",1,0,0,1,Protecting religious rights when it comes to what is injected into myself and my family is of extremely high priority. ,"religious, God, allergies, hepatitis B",0,0,0,0,0,
FEB,2019,Erika Geuser ,Concerned Citizen ,"I thank you for your time. My name is Erica Geuser. I’m a constitutionalist and a hip-hop activist that stands for freedom, justice, and human rights. I’m honored to be representing the Sweet Angel Babies, those whose lives have been taken at the hands of your recommendations. This patriotic dress I’m wearing should represent freedom and justice, but instead holds the names of so many victims. These injustices are being committed by our very own government and the agencies tasked to keep us healthy and safe. Last night I added a new name to my dress, the first red stripe here, Christopher Eugene Bunch. His brother rather sadly did not get selected to speak and wanted to address this committee today. I’m very connected to my higher power and as a messenger of God, when you’re called upon there is no question. I will always be a voice for the voiceless. This young man lost a huge part of himself along with his little brother to the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine. His family’s life has been destroyed by a pharmaceutical product that was recommended to them by the ACIP. The World Health Organization says the risk of getting cervical cancer is 1 in 40,000. Yet, studies show that 1 in 500 girls suffered serious injury or death from Gardasil®. I want to share Jeremiah’s words with you today, “On December 5, 2003, I became a big brother. What I didn’t know then was that our time together was limited. I did, however, know that my best bud had just been born. Over the years, I have shown him some things like how to hide from mom when he was in trouble, how to ride his bike, and how to play baseball. I taught him everything he needed to know, and he was just lucky enough to possess mad skills. The kid was perfect. Our mom and dad divorced shortly after Chris was born; however, one thing remained the same and that was my brother. My best friend. We had plans for the future, including major league baseball and traveling the world together. As we got older, we got caught up in our own lives. I have regrets of not spending more time with him or attending more ballgames and riding more, or getting to know this bigger version of my best little friend. On August 14, 2018, that opportunity was taken from me. For a whole week, my brother laid in hospital bed. I held his hand. I told him stories from our childhood. I reminded him that we had plans. I told him I didn’t think I could do it without him. I apologized for the things I didn’t do and admitted how cool his hair was really despite the things I said when I was mad, and that if he came home with me, then he could wear my clothes every day. You met my parents in October and now you are meeting me. I hope you see what you have done to my family. You say these adverse reactions are rare; however, when it’s your family member, your brother, your best friend, it doesn’t feel so rare. My whole life is different. All I have left are memories and the questions, “Why? Why my baby brother?” Hearing these heartbreaking stories day in and day out, having vaccine-injured loved ones, and being damaged myself, it’s hard not to get angry. Seeing our religious freedoms being challenged over a pharmaceutical product is beyond angering. So, in honor of one of Christopher’s and my favorite hip-hop artist, I would like to end my comment with a quote by Tupac Shakur, ‘Out of anger comes controversy, out of controversy comes conversation, and out of conversation comes action’ and that’s what we need from you guys.” Thank you so much.",1,0,0,2,His family’s life has been destroyed by a pharmaceutical product that was recommended to them by the ACIP,"patriotic, HPV, injury",2,"Yet, studies show that 1 in 500 girls suffered serious injury or death from Gardasil®.

JUNE,2019,Ms. Lynette Barron ,Barron 10 Acre Farm ,"Hey, ACIP. It’s good to be back. I’ve been coming here for several years now trying to bring your post-market data to you and show you what the results of these vaccines are actually doing to us—to our families. It’s very sad that we have to keep coming. It’s very sad that this is even a topic really, because well, goodness, you’d think that we could all get along, and we could talk about these things, and you would look at the science other than the science that is being bought. I have actually seen something today that I was kind of floored by, which was you guys actually conversating about something—talking it through. That kind of blew my mind. I’m not sure if it’s because there’s way more press in the room today, or if you’re actually being genuine with your concerns. But, it was nice to at least see you guys talking things out today, so that’s a welcomed change. I’m sad to see the velvet rope that got put up last time and kind of blocking the interaction between y’all and us, because we’re all human beings at the end of the day and we all want what’s best for our kids and our families. So, that to me was a sad addition to this room. We don’t come here to cause problems. We don’t come here to cause disarray. We come here because we want you to understand what your post-market data really does look like, and it is these people back here. It is our children. It is our families that have been affected. When we go home, we don’t get to take a break from this. Like, you leave this room, you know, we have to go home and our crying children who are smearing poop and who can’t talk, and who can’t do half of the things or more that they should be doing because of the vaccines. It’s mind-blowing to think that y’all aren’t looking at those things. You literally talk about the safety and efficacy and so many times, everything is “assumed,” everything is “probably,” it’s “uncertain.” Every death that is talked about is written off and pushed under the rug as “it wasn’t related.” At some point, you must realize that you can’t keep sweeping it under the rug and you actually have to look at the causes. I mean, your studies really show you half these things and you just make it statistically non-important. It doesn’t make sense. I really do hope that I will keep coming back. As I told y’all last June, I will be here on the frontline like I have been and I really do hope to keep seeing improvements, and I hope this goes away. I really do enjoy talking to y’all. I enjoy getting to know you and y’all getting to know us. Like I said, we’re all humans at the end of the day. Treat each other with respect. We don’t come here to disrespect you or the process of this. We come here because we really do want you to understand where we’re coming from as parents. I’m sure many of you are parents. We want the best for your kids, too. I know I do. I don’t know at the end of the day what your goals are, what your motivations are, but if you’re not listening to the people that are receiving these vaccines and telling you something is wrong, something bad has happened here, then I don’t understand where you’re looking. Because we are your post-market data. Honestly, my family is done being your post-market data. I’m pretty sure most of my friends feel the same way here. I really do hope though that we watch the science improve and actually see real science come into this room. There are a lot of people who aren’t being paid by big pharmaceutical companies who do a lot of studies, and you guys should be looking at those because they show a lot. Thank you.

JUNE,2019,Kip Adams,Executive Vice President Corporate Relations COPD Foundation ,"My name is Kip Adams. I’m here on behalf of the COPD Foundation, which represents more than 16 million Americans that are diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pfizer is one of our 21 corporate partners. They were not involved in the preparation of this statement, and I receive no support for my travel expenses. The COPD Foundation’s mission is to prevent and cure COPD and improve the lives of patients and their caregivers affected by the disease. My purpose today is to express our strong opposition to any changes in the current PCV13 recommendation for adults age 65 and older. COPD patients have a 6 to 8 times greater risk for community-acquired pneumonia, or CAP. When a COPD patient gets CAP, they have increased risk for developing exacerbations in the future. We conducted a study of people with COPD who have been diagnosed with CAP within the last 4 months. The average age was 50. They reported that CAP kept them from their work and usual activities for periods up to 2 to 6 or even more weeks. In addition, over 84% reported requiring assistance from family and friends for an average of over 4 weeks. We also found that CAP symptoms like cough and weakness limited people with COPD’s ability to go outside of their home and interact with others. Given the challenges COPD patients face in obtaining comprehensive care with existing vaccination rates already unacceptably low, changing the pneumococcal recommendations would be devastating to COPD patients’ health and quality of life and against the goals of Healthy People 2020 and the recently passed House Appropriations Bill which calls for greater focus on improving pneumococcal vaccination rates. There has not been enough time or focus on increasing pneumococcal vaccination rates to ensure adults, especially those at greater risk, can benefit from PCV13 (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13). A change would result in access issues and physician confusion that would cause lower percentages of COPD patients benefitting from the protection that both vaccinations offer, especially given that the current recommendations for immunocompromised patients do not include COPD patients. Further, simply downgrading the recommendation to be based on a physician’s judgement is not a viable option, especially for our complex population. There is a high likelihood that delays in any pneumococcal vaccination will occur as a result of confusion over the change, and the fact that many are immunized at a pharmacy, and since PCV13 is recommended to be first. Finally, I wish to provide you feedback of several quotes from our community of patients. We have a social network. One quote, “Getting over a month of home health care and hospitalizations for pneumonia and COPD flare and new heart issues now, I’m not the same person I was a month ago.” Another quote, “The hardest thing about pneumonia is taking so long to get back feeling like yourself again. It was a much slower process than I thought.” Thank you.

JUNE,2019,Janelle Sullivan ,"Founder, Heartline Foundation","Hi. I’m Janelle Sullivan, Founder of Heartline Foundation. I have a vaccine-injured child. My son was severely injured from his MMR (measles mumps rubella) shot, and he was even more severely injured from the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) and the flu shot. He had a seizure afterwards. I was told that that was completely normal. It would have happened anyway because he had autism. Well, my son no longer has autism. I detoxed his vaccines homeopathically. Re-experience all the reactions that he had: puking out the nose, head- banking, biting, poop art. And guess what? Today he is neurotypical. I recovered him the exact same way that Jennifer McCarthy did. When I looked at these papers and it says, “For parents with concerns about vaccines and autism,” you guys want them to read “Autism’s False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure” by Paul Offit. That’s how I recovered my child—everything that he campaigns against. The homeopathic remedy, belladonna, got my son to stop biting himself to bleed instantly. He goes on the news and says it causes irreversible neurological damage, seizures, and death. My pediatrician repeated that to me. It didn’t cause him anything. I still gave it to him and he’s still on it, and when I ran out of it or misplaced it, I got a note home from the IU he was back to biting his hands. Next I was told that gluten was a load of garbage and it wouldn’t hurt him. It caused my son to bang his head on cement to bleed and lose all speech. Without it, he can at least repeat words and his self- harming went down dramatically. That’s important. Next, she told me that I could safely give my child 3 vaccines at a time after a seizure. On top of that, after his reaction from 2 months, I thought he was going to die. So, pediatrician downplays that. It’s crazy. So, I wanted 1 vaccine at a time. On 4 occasions, they gave my child 2 to 5 vaccines. Informed dis-consent. It is written in my son’s medical file that I want 1 vaccine at a time, but they gave him chicken pox and hepatitis A. Now when my son was born I was told, “Do you want to vaccinate him for a sexually transmitted disease that he can’t possibly catch?” I said, “No. I don’t want to do that.” So, he was 2 months old. I told the pediatrician, “Don’t give him any unnecessary vaccines.” She said, “HepA is not necessary.” That was to trick me into giving him HepB and everything on the schedule. That was not honest. Then when he got the chicken pox vaccine, he got hepatitis A also. Not honest. Our kids matter. They absolutely matter. Jennifer McCarthy did not start the anti-vaccine movement. She started the autism recovery movement. The idea that you guys want to make autism neurodiversity something celebrated, no.

JUNE,2019,Alexandra Ponsica ,Concerned Parent ,"Thank you for letting me speak today in front of your committee. Both my husband and I are actually in the public health field. I’m also a mother to twin 7-year old boys with severe autism whom we know to be vaccine-injured. From one public health person to another, I come to you with a heavy heart and feel burdened that you are dismissing the largest public health threat we have ever faced. In public health, we have been taught about the corruption in health history and unethical research practices: Nuremberg Trials, Tuskegee Study, the tobacco industry, et cetera. In these times, we are not exempt from this occurring again, for it is in fact occurring again. I’m tired, I’m sad, I’m angry, I’m broken because of my boys’ suffering. We wake up every day trying to give them the best life that we can. They cannot perform the simplest of activities of daily living without full support. They are still in diapers and they poop smear their faces and walls countless times a day. They head bang against the walls when they are frustrated or cannot communicate. Going out in public is near impossible and if we try, it is exhausting. We are heartbroken over watching them struggle. One study showed parents of children with autism have the same cortisol levels as Holocaust Survivors. The average lifespan of an individual with autism is 36 years. If the rate of autism continues to accelerate at current rates, by 2032 1 in 2 children, 1 in 2, will be on the spectrum. If every child on the spectrum is as severe as my boys, I guarantee you our way of life as a society will be unsustainable. By dismissing this issue, you are creating greater issues and larger health disparities amongst a group of vulnerable individuals. Your recommendations are being used to take away an individual’s innate human right to bodily autonomy without discrimination or coercion. Your recommendations are meant to do no harm, yet harm they do. The claim that vaccines don’t cause autism does not have the science to back it up. You have not done a true vaccinated versus unvaccinated study. The Denmark study does not qualify as it deceptively claims that vaccinated subjects were unvaccinated. It is troubling that you are about to vote on a combination vaccine which had 35 deaths in the children due to SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). We do not know what the ingredients in vaccines do once they enter the body. We do not know how they react synergistically within the body, whether they lay dormant or exit the body, whether they enter the brain or how they affect the brain, and on and on the questions go. My boys’ lives were stripped away from them. I beg you to call a moratorium on further vaccination recommendations until you can undoubtedly answer these questions. Please read “How to End the Autism Epidemic” by J.B. Handley, which reviews all of the scientific literature you have been missing. As a reminder, Rachel Carson was once ostracized for her controversial book “Silent Spring” demonizing DDT(dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and now DDT is banned. So, unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not.",1,0,0,1,I’m also a mother to twin 7-year old boys with severe autism whom we know to be vaccine-injured. ,"autism, Nuremberg, Tuskegee,children, SIDS",0,0,0,I beg you to call a moratorium on further vaccination recommendations until you can undoubtedly answer these questions. ,"If the rate of autism continues to accelerate at current rates, by 2032 1 in 2 children, 1 in 2, will be on the spectrum.",
JUNE,2019,MaryJo Perry,Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights (MPVR) ,"Good afternoon. I’m MaryJo Perry representing Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights. Mississippi leads the nation in vaccine coverage rates. We also have the highest infant mortality rate in the developed world. While the reasons that our children are sick and dying involve many factors, please consider: Jamie Penton of Carriere, Mississippi died the day after 2-month vaccines. Anna Sims of Oxford, Mississippi died 7 hours after 2-month vaccines. Last week, tiny Aubrey Harris of Columbus, Mississippi was found dead less than 48 hours after vaccines at just 6 weeks old. I could go on. Injuries and deaths are not rare. It is time to listen to the parents. Health officials trot out the statement that “vaccines are the victim of their own success.” No, that’s incorrect. Vaccines are victims of a greedy drug industry, powerful medical trade organizations, and their bedfellows in government. Vaccines are victims of this committee and its associates who have made overzealous, myopic decisions that have unwittingly fueled the movement that you call “anti-vaccine.” Along with our children, the vaccine program is your victim. I’ll explain. We don’t buy that our children in the United States of America (USA) with clean running water, plentiful food, electricity, and state-of-the-art medical care must have all of this to grow up safe and healthy in 2019 [holding up a vaccine schedule]. Our children’s check- ups have become high-pressure vaccine sales appointments that are more dreadful than walking onto a used car sales lot. We’re outraged at the unethical practice of families being terminated by pediatricians for refusing to follow the vaccine schedule exactly. The AstroTurf backed by the drug industry and CDC, such as Voices for Vaccines, is obvious. Media hype and engineered hysteria with repeated talking points from one news outlet to the next is tired and overplayed. An orchestrated attack on vaccine freedom has descended on legislatures that is so alarming that many who call themselves “pro vaccine” are seeing clearly where this agenda is heading. Whistleblowers from the inside are stepping forward daily. I get it. Our movement is an annoyance and frustrates your efforts. But how many of you would be considered to past conflicting interest to your seat on this committee. As this committee makes decisions on how to advise our government on vaccines, I urge you to be mindful that the aggressive vaccine campaign has betrayed the public trust and backfired. Vaccines are not a victim of success. Vaccines are your victim. As a representative of the families of the most heavily vaccinated children in the nation, I implore you to temper your vaccine enthusiasm with balance and common sense. Thank you.

JUNE,2019,Megan Knauf-Ford ,Concerned Mother ,"Hi friends. I’m Megan. I have 2 little boys ages 2 and 5 and I drove here from Greenville, South Carolina. I’m going to tell you why I’m here in just a minute, but before that, I want to take you on a little journey back in time. Please close your eyes or lower your gaze to your lap. I want you to take yourself back to the day when your first child was born. I want you to remember how you felt in that moment. I want you to reflect back on what it was like to hold that precious bundle in your arms for the first time and to gaze into their perfect little face. Remember all the love that you felt in your heart. It was the best day of your life and mine, too. Now you’re probably wondering why I took you on that little journey, and it’s to pave the way so that you are ready to receive the information that I have for you. I’d like for you to look at me while I share my message with you. See, my story is different than everyone else in this room. I didn’t vaccinate my boys. I went with my gut and my gut said, “No.” My instincts said there is not enough safety data. The same instincts that you and yours were born with, it’s innate. It’s in all of us. We share the same instinct to protect our children. That’s why I’m here. This might sound ridiculous to you and you might be thinking, “Megan, you don’t know. You’re just a mother.” And I would say to you, Friend, this voting on vaccines with little to no safety data is not enough for this mother. As you reflect back on the happenings of today on your drive home and as you lay your head on your pillow tonight, I have one question for you. Are you doing enough with the information that you have? You have been given a high calling. Is this enough? Are you doing what you were created to do? I know that there is at least one of you that will answer “No” to that question and it’s you that I am speaking to today. We need you. You have been chosen. It’s time to voice your concern, because you know that the greater good should not look like survival of the fittest. Your job is to protect the public. That means all of us, not just some of us. I want you to ask for the study and do the job that you were called to do. We need your voice. It’s time to believe the mothers.

JUNE,2019,Sally Greenberg,National Consumers League (NCL) ,"Good afternoon Dr. Romero, members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. My name is Sally Greenberg and I am here today on behalf of the National Consumers League. Thank you for what you do for the health and wellbeing of all Americans, and for the opportunity to speak here today. The National Consumers League is passionately pro-vaccine for a reason. The League was founded in 1899 and our first leader, General Secretary Florence Kelly, described in her letters the devastating effects to her family in losing several siblings to diphtheria, a disease we don’t see anymore. We’ve forgotten the ravages of these terrible disease on families. I personally grew up with my uncle, Roger. He contracted the poliovirus in 1953 before the Salk vaccine was developed. He spent the remainder of his life in a wheelchair, often gasping for breath, and slept on a rocking bed to breath. He needed 24-hour care and eventually died of disease complications. The National Consumers League is a strong proponent of vaccines, truly medicine’s most precious gift to the human race. Time to listen to the parents. Well, I’m a parent also. I thank all of you here for the fact that my 23 year old son, who lives in Mississippi, is a very healthy young man who does not have to worry about HPV (human papillomavirus), chicken pox, measles, mumps, whooping cough, and all the other terrible diseases that parents lived in fear of for many, many generations. On to my next point, as you know, the CDC recommends that all adults aged 65 plus be vaccinated with the pneumococcal conjugate, PCV13 vaccine, and the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. According to the CDC, these two vaccines have been proven to protect against pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia. As a result of ACIP’s 2014 and 2015 pneumococcal vaccine recommendations and Medicare coverage of these vaccines, over 66% of the total US population has been vaccinated again pneumococcal disease. I include myself in that number as of 2016. While impressive, this figure falls well below Healthy People 2020 target of 90% of non-institutionalized adults aged 65 plus who are vaccinated against pneumococcal diseases. In order to continue to make strides toward achieving the Healthy People 2020 goal, we believe Medicare coverage must be maintained, which is dependent upon maintaining the current recommendations. According to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), influenza and pneumonia are the 8th leading cause of death in the United States. We fear that without ACIP’s recommendations, the current pneumococcal vaccination recommendations, which also protect patients against co-morbidities caused by pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia will further burden healthcare resources. Finally, changing ACIP’s recommendations for the pneumococcal vaccination now could . . . (time expired). Okay, thank you very much for your time.

JUNE,2019,Karen Ernst,"Director, Voices for Vaccines ","Hi. My name is Karen Ernst and I am the Director of Voices for Vaccines. I have no disclosures to make. I am here today to represent the vast majority of parents, the ones upset that we have had more measles cases in the United States since 1992, and those who want communities protected from outbreaks of all vaccine-preventable diseases. I represent millions upon millions of people who trust ACIP to do the hard work of creating a science-supported, evidence-based immunization schedule so that they do not need to worry about how or when to vaccinate their children. When I first took the helm of Voices for Vaccines, these parents were not at all represented. In the media, on federal boards, and in any number of decision-making bodies, a parent voice concerning vaccines was a voice of those opposed to vaccines. A lot has changed in those few short years, including more parents becoming increasingly concerned about this non-scientific opposition to immunization. Policymakers and media are beginning to pay attention to this majority as we become more vocal. But as parents do become more vocal in support of vaccines, vaccine-hesitancy continues to spread to the point that the WHO (World Health Organization) considers it one of the greatest threats to public health. In response, private organizations have begun to de-platform and de-monetize antivaccine misinformation. From GoFundMe®, to Mailchimp®, to YouTube, to Pinterest, many companies are responding to this very real public threat. At the same time, ACIP faces a challenge as some try to turn these meetings into a platform for opposition to immunization. Let’s be clear about that, too. What we are hearing at these meetings is not vaccine hesitancy. It’s not fear, but an attempt to muddy science and create doubt. I recognize that CDC has legal duties to allow public expression that private companies do not have. However, this platform is being used now in an effort to lend credibility to misinformation and pseudoscience. I call on all ACIP members to consider ways to counter untrue assertions made here. The public needs you to respond directly after untrue assertions are made in the room. If we cannot de-platform misinformation, we need to correct and fact check it for the public. Vaccine hesitancy is real and it is created by misinformation, fraud, and propaganda. I urge each of you to work toward greater vaccine acceptance each day until we are no longer seeing parents choose measles, meningitis, and pneumonia over immunization. Thank you.

JUNE,2019,Mary Flasche ,Concerned Individual ,"Hi. I’m Mary Flasche. Ladies and gentleman, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986 granted the pharmaceutical industry economic immunity from injuries and deaths caused by vaccines up to the age of 18. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was assigned responsibility to assure safety and efficacy testing of vaccines in order to reduce the risk of adverse vaccine reactions. To assure HHS meets the required obligations, HHS was also required to submit biennial reports to Congress detailing the prior 2-year improvements in vaccine safety. On August 25, 2017, Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking copies of the supposed safety and efficacy reports submitted to Congress staring in 1988 and every 2 years after. HHS stalled, leading to a lawsuit in which HHS ultimately admitted that not even 1 safety and efficacy report had been submitted. Since 1989, the vaccine schedule for children has steadily increased while America’s children’s health has steadily decreased until over half of America’s children suffer from a chronic condition, disability, or disease. Actually, when it comes to health, the only category America ranks number one in in comparable countries is the infant mortality rate. These alarming facts alone are grounds for immediate halting of vaccine mandates being fast-tracked nationwide and should absolutely nullify the liability-free National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.

JUNE,2019,Susan Corgan ,Concerned Individual ,"Hello. My name is Susan Corgan. Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity to address you today. Yesterday, I was in an Ohio State House meeting with Legislators to talk to them about bills that are removing vaccine exemptions. When I went and met with these Legislators, we had some eye-opening conversations. Many of those were the fact that they did not understand these laws that they were about to pass. They did not know that if they removed the religious and personal belief exemptions that they would be mandating vaccines for all of their citizens. They did not understand that you guys have the power to recommend any onslaught of vaccines that you want to that this committee decides to recommend and that then their citizen will have to go get those to attend school, daycare, or private school. This is happening. Vaccines are being mandated all throughout our county. This just happened in New York where, in one day, they removed the religious exemption for children to attend school. It went into effect immediately and now none of these children are going to be getting fair and appropriate public education as required by federal law. There will be lawsuits filed. I am here today to talk to you because I understand that you have a very difficult job before you. You, like me and so many other parents here, want the best for our kids. We want them to have healthy, happy, fruitful futures. We want to give them everything that we’ve had and so much more. With what’s going on right now in this country and the lack of education with our Legislators, with our doctors, with our scientists, the disconnect between the parents, the medical professionals, the committees like ACIP—we have got to try to find some common ground. I actually agree with the speaker before me here that said that there should be some kind of back-and-forth conversation. I would love to be able to come to the microphone and ask a question and to get a response, so that we can work together for the best for our children and for their futures. Thank you very much.

JUNE,2019,"Sarah Fankhauser, PhD","Assistant Professor of Biology , Oxford College of Emory University","Good afternoon. My name is Sarah Fankhauser and I’m an Assistant Professor of Biology at Oxford College of Emory University and I hold a PhD in Microbiology and Immunology from Harvard University. The campus that I am on is home to about 900 undergraduate residential students and hundreds of faculty and staff. It is a close-knit campus and like other college campuses, infectious disease can spread quickly due to our tight quarters, constant interaction, and open campus that brings together many different people. I am here today as someone who is concerned for my students and my colleagues, but my concerns are not localized to my campus alone and are shared across all campuses and similar environments. I personally know many students and faculty and staff who are immunocompromised and who cannot be vaccinated for legitimate reasons. Many of our faculty and staff also have young children at home, as do I, who are constantly being exposed to whatever we bring home from campus. Beyond this, we have numerous community members and others that visit our campus daily. I commend you for the work that you are doing. I also understand that the priority population for many of these vaccines are adolescents. I also agree that the evidence strongly shows that vaccinating children protects other vulnerable populations. But I urge you to continue to emphasize the importance of adult vaccination and catch-up vaccinations and finally, to support these without compromising other populations such as adolescents. Not only will this help limit the potential of outbreaks on college campuses and similar communities that bring together large and diverse populations, but it will also encourage students who may come to college non- vaccinated or under-vaccinated to consider the option of vaccination.

JUNE,2019,Sheri Gagnon ,Concerned Individual ,"Hello. I’m Sheri Gagnon and I thank God for this opportunity. I am alarmed by how this committee makes decisions. This committee approved adding a hepatitis B formula with a new adjuvant to the infant schedule when questions were being satisfied with the answer of “no data is available.” This committee’s lack of need for scientific evidence was reinforced with the statement, “While pre-clinical studies were not done using these vaccines simultaneously, our general approach to immunizations is that they be given at the same time in different limbs.” That’s is reckless and the kind of scientific approach that no one should trust. Speaking with my elders has confirmed that this new sense of urgency to protect our community from vaccine- preventable diseases is an absolute falsehood. I had chicken pox in 9th grade. The school nurse confirmed it, sent me home with a smile, and there were no doctors and no prime time news report. Nobody was concerned about chicken pox in the 80s. The tone of my elders was also nonchalant as they spoke about their experiences and how their parents acted. Why did that tone change? Lack of sales? I was highly cautioned that my kids must have the vaccine because chicken pox could cause meningitis leading to death. Now the VARIVAX® insert, Section 6.2: Post-Marketing Experience says “. . .meningitis caused by vaccine strain varicella virus have been reported in immunocompetent individuals previously vaccinated with VARIVAX® months to years after vaccination.” Well, that means the vaccine users are at risk for what they were trying to avoid and are putting other vaccine users at a higher risk. In February, I was greatly concerned about the proposed anthrax recommendation. My husband is a retired Veteran and he was required to receive multiple doses of the anthrax vaccine during his Active Duty years. I did become speechless when the discussion became overly belabored on how to re-phrase the booster recommendation. I do want to thank the committee member who persisted until the terminology for that vaccine designation was properly rewritten to read as a choice rather than a benefit-tied requirement. So, I’ll finish up with a couple of points. The comprehensive national use of the Evidence-based Synthesis Program (ESP) system will provide all of the data that is needed for the actual risk assessments. The creating of fear in parents while the true risk of vaccine use is being suppressed is criminal.

We appreciate these meetings and being able to be here and see what you guys do. But, please don’t take what I’m about to say as rude. I am a mother of 4. I vaccinated my first. I didn’t know of any of the risks. My doctor didn’t tell me. I did what I was supposed to do. I trusted him. My child was sick constantly. I didn’t know what was wrong with him. I asked his doctor. He didn’t know, “It must be a virus. Let’s just let it run its course.” I started to ask some friends who also had children and they would give me advice, “Do this. Do that.” One person asked me if I vaccinated. I said, “Of course I do. Why wouldn’t I?” She said, “No. Go read the insert. Go look at the ingredients.” As soon as I did, I knew in my heart I had to stop. I couldn’t believe what I saw, and I still to this day, everything I learn is just mind-blowing that so many of these risks have been hidden and we cannot allow that any longer.

We can’t allow for fraud and lies to happen any longer. It’s our children’s lives. Yes, vaccines may have done some good. The theory of vaccinating, to be able to become immune to something, is a good idea. But when vaccines are causing more issues than what they’re supposed to be benefitting, we need to rethink about how we’re immunizing our children, because our children are sick and we can’t do this anymore.

JUNE,2019,Edwin Barreiro ,Concerned Parent ,"Good afternoon. My name is Edwin Barreiro. I’m not a doctor and I don’t play one on TV, but I have two 7-year-old injured grandchildren. You heard my daughter talk about them yesterday. I want to discuss something with you. You see my shirt? It says, “Fake News.” I want to share fake news with you. It’s “Vaccines are safe and effective.” I think as scientists sitting here, you know that that statement can’t possibly be true. Why? Because the US Supreme Court ruled that vaccines are unavoidably unsafe. So, they can’t be totally safe. No, I would change that to, “Vaccines are relatively safe and effective.” I think you’d be okay with that and I think we’d be closer to the truth, but not quite there yet. Case in point, VIOXX®. Has anyone heard of VIOXX®? VIOXX® was a drug that was introduced in 1999 by Merck. Some of their representatives are here, and you probably were previous representatives. It was approved in 1999. It was taken off the market in 2004. Why was it taken off the marker? David Graham of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said that VIOXX®, in the 6 years it was out in the wild, killed at least 60,000 people. 60,000 people. I’m not going to go over the whole story, because we know this story. The fact is, the proper studies were done on VIOXX® and Merck lied and people died. Now, the reason why I bring that up and I know you’re not dealing with drugs here, you’re dealing with vaccines. The reason why I bring that up is because VIOXX® was tested more rigorously than any vaccine that Merck or any other company has created. People don’t know this. Drugs go through multiple inert placebo-control studies before coming to market. Saying otherwise is fake news. Dr. Theresa Deisher said that none of these studies are done on vaccines. You know that none of the inert placebo double-blind studies are done on vaccines. You talk about them. The FDA approves them just like they approved VIOXX®, but the studies have not been done. She said, and I hope that you have heard some of what she said, she actually wrote a letter about the fact that Legislators are out there trying to mandate these to everyone. That’s what Susie talked about before. [Dr. Deisher said] “Merck’s MMR II vaccine (as well as the chickenpox, Pentacel, and all Hep-A containing vaccines) is manufactured using human fetal cell lines and is heavily contaminated with human fetal DNA from the production process. Levels in our children can reach up to 5 ng/ml after vaccination, depending on the age, weight and blood volume of the child. That level is known to activate Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), which can cause autoimmune attacks.” Still quoting, “Anyone who says that the fetal DNA contaminating our vaccines is harmless either does not know anything about immunity and Toll- like receptors or they are not telling the truth.” Now I know you guys know about Toll-like receptors. “If fetal DNA can trigger labor (a naturally desired autoimmune reaction), then those same levels in vaccines can trigger autoimmunity in a child. Fragmented fetal DNA contained in vaccines is of similar size, ~215 base pairs. This is direct biological evidence that fetal DNA contaminants in vaccines are not in low innocuous amounts. They are a very strong proinflammatory trigger.” If this committee doesn’t change its direction, we’re likely to end up where we’re headed, with an autism rate of 1 in 2.

JUNE,2019,KJ Moore,"Carpe Diem Nursing, Inc. ","Good afternoon. My name is KJ Moore, RN, BSN of 10 years, owner of Carpe Diem Nursing. I did not become a nurse to help the government force vaccinations on the population. As a nurse, I was not taught the depths of ingredients that make up a vaccine or the risks involved. I was only told that they were safe and effective. I wish this were true and we could all go on about our day, but the evidence to prove that vaccines not only maim but also kill is so overwhelming that we who speak up are being labeled “Angry Anti-Vaxers” and we’re being silenced for speaking the truth. Dr. Robert Bell, former Vice President of the International Society for Cancer Research at the British Cancer Hospital states, “The chief if not sole cause of the monstrous increase in cancer has been vaccinations.” Not ironically, Australia has been mandating vaccines and their cancer rate is 1 in 2. We the people are seeing that vaccine safety is as much a myth as herd immunity. Vaccines are a failure and the ACIP panel are turning a blind eye to real life matters. What you should truly be discussing at these quarterly meetings is why Merck is under investigation for fraud on the efficacy studies for the mumps portion of the MMR vaccine and what you’re going to do about it. The MMR is ineffective. There have been two measles deaths since 2000, but the National Vaccine Information Center states that as of March 31, 2018 there have been 89,355 reports of measles vaccines reactions, hospitalizations, injuries, and deaths following measles vaccine made to the federal VAERS, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System: 445 deaths, 6196 hospitalizations, 1657 related disabilities. Over 60% of those adverse effects occurred in children under the age of 3. Merck is being sued for the shingles vaccine. Merck is being sued for the GARDASIL® vaccine. HPV vaccine sales are generating Merck $4.6 million a day. No wonder you want us to all be quiet. Miller's Review of Critical Vaccine Studies states, “Measles can spread from fully vaccinated individuals to other fully vaccinated individuals. When Healthy People 2020 is here, mandated vaccines, and Nationwide 5G 2020 is here, microwave radiation every 250 feet, and everyone is getting their mandated DNA-altering vaccines, what are you going to talk about here when everyone is so sick from them? Let me guess. More recommendations for more vaccines. DNA sequences emit low-frequency electromagnetic waves, which make up DNA signals that arrange the pattern of raw DNA. Signals can potentially communicate with each other and genetically mutate, receiving data transmission. What I’m saying is that they communicate on a cellular, and we are destroying our cells via microwave radiation and vaccines on cellular level. All living organisms interact and connect with electromagnetic waves. The earth has a pulse and so do we. We are being deliberately disconnected, and this is spiritual warfare. Just because something is mandated doesn’t make it safe. We will not comply. A quote from Brett Wilcox, “Vaccines are safe and effective. In a religious sense, it’s a creed. In organizational terms, it’s policy. In marketing, it’s the hook. In social psychology, it’s propaganda. In literary parlance, it’s myth. In legal terms, it’s fraud. Under oath, it’s perjury.” Thank you very much.",0,1,0,1,"I wish this were true and we could all go on about our day, but the evidence to prove that vaccines not only maim but also kill is so overwhelming that we who speak up are being labeled “Angry Anti-Vaxers” and we’re being silenced for speaking the truth.

OCT,2019,Wendy Umetsu ,Concerned Parent ,"My son, Hiro, was born January 2014 and we began to follow the vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC. This picture was taken after he seized for almost an hour following his 4-month shots. Although I informed the medical staff that he had recently been vaccinated, my concerns were dismissed. I had been a mother for 15 years and this was my third child, so imagine my surprise when I was told that this was normal. He continued to receive shots on schedule as recommended—30 doses in just the first year of his life. He continued to have vaccine reactions that the medical staff never reported to VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). My son was being set up for a lifetime of health problems to include seizures, food allergies, ear infections, respiratory issues, and likely death if we had continued to vaccinate him. Although he had two normal electroencephalogram (EEGs) the first year of his life, he began to have new seizures after his 12-month shots and has not had a normal EEG since. He was diagnosed with intractable epilepsy with at least 7 different seizure types. I had no choice but to put my son on medication that was not even approved for children his age. As a result, he suffered from numerous side-effects and drug addiction at the age of 1. The healthcare industry failed my child, and I was not going to allow his decline in health to continue. I researched vaccines and I began the process of healing my son. I obtained medical records and filed VAERS reports on my own. I had testing done, which showed aluminum and mercury toxicity—both ingredients in vaccines. I read from the CDC website that due to a family history of autoimmune disorders, none of my children, 4 of them, should have received several of the vaccines they were given. In addition, blood testing has since confirmed that my children are susceptible to vaccine injury. The vaccine schedule is being religiously followed by doctors without concern of contraindications listed by the CDC that should be discussed with patients in the clinical setting. It is not being done. Parents are not receiving informed consent at vaccine visits. From my experience, your child receives a shot and then afterwards, you are given a VIS statement that looks like this (holds up the statement). The inserts look like this (unfolds and holds up a package insert). In addition, vaccine reactions are not being reported to VAERS and there is not an accurate representation of the post-market data that is being considered when discussing your vaccination recommendations. My son, Hiro, will be 6 in January. He has had thousands of seizures in his lifetime. He still wears diapers, cannot talk, and requires constant care and supervision. I wake up every day of life checking to make sure my son is still alive and hasn’t died in his sleep. That’s our reality and the reality of thousands and thousands of families who have stories just like ours. I’m here speaking today to be a voice for Hiro and other victims like him. Many of us now know that the vaccines we once believed would protect our children are the very reason many of our children are so sick with chronic health issues today.

OCT,2019,Eve Switzer ,Northwest Pediatrics ,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment today. My name is Dr. Eve Switzer. Although I am from Oklahoma, I am not related to Barry. I am a parent. Both of my children are young adults and are fully vaccinated per the recommended schedule, including MenB vaccine, because vaccine benefits far exceed their risks. This is supported by the science. I am also a pediatrician in rural private practice where I, not my nurse, personally give vaccines to my patients. I was in clinical practice before the widespread use of vaccine against varicella, haemophilus, strep pneumo, and rotavirus. I admitted and cared for children in the hospital with haemophilus meningitis, invasive strep pneumo infections, dehydration from rotavirus gastroenteritis, as well as even necrotizing fasciitis from chicken pox. I don’t miss those days. Thanks to vaccination and other health advances, it is far, far less common for a pediatrician like me in the rural frontlines of healthcare to have to admit children to the hospital for preventable infectious diseases. As an active member of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) at both the state and national levels, I also hold a leadership position at the national level. I interact with many of my pediatric colleagues. When I received notification of the opportunity to comment today, I queried the colleagues in my office, in my state AAP chapter, as well as the AAP Section on Administration and Practice Management (SOAPM). The number one request from pediatricians like me on the frontlines was for better guidance on the MenB vaccine. Quoting from one of my colleagues in the Section on Administration and Practice Management, “When the science is most vague is when the most guidance is needed, not the least.” At a time where pro-vaccine pediatricians are being verbally and physically assaulted—legislators are having menstrual blood thrown at them and parents who have lost a child to a preventable disease and advocate for vaccination are being attacked on social media—I applaud the difficult work you do and condemn the abuse you and others who want to protect their children with vaccines are subjected to. The recommendations you make are extremely important, not only for me and my medical colleagues, but also for parents who need clear science-based schedules to protect their children. I and many others like me, including parents, pediatricians, and other health care providers (HCP) thank you for doing that work.

OCT,2019,Dr. James Neuenschwander,American Association of Physician Specialists (AAPS) ,"That’s Dr. James Neuenschwander. I’m a physician with dual board certifications in emergency and integrated medicine. I have had the honor in the past 32 years of evaluating thousands of children. The parents of those children, to their dying breaths, say that it was a vaccine that caused their child to descend into autism. It was a vaccine that caused their child’s neurologic disorder. It was a vaccine that causes their child’s asthma, their child’s eczema, their child’s food allergy. I know there is a huge disconnect between what these parents are telling us and what you guys are teaching us. I also know as an ER (emergency room) physician and by personal experience, ignore mom or dad at your own peril. But I’m not here today to debate the safety and efficacy of vaccines. I will, however, challenge each and every one of you in this room to that debate. I will challenge the CDC, the NIH (National Institutes of Health ), any university out there to that debate in a public forum. But, I know it will never happen. The science isn’t there. I’m all about the science. The biggest cause of vaccine hesitancy in this country is the lack of true vaccine science. I am here today to ask you guys in this committee to please, the community counts on you. Do your job. I used to naively think that ACIP based all of their recommendations on rigorous study of multiple trials that determine the safety and efficacy of each one of your recommendations. I have since learned that ACIP is simply participating in an industry-wide phenomenon I’m going to call “junk science.” Junk science has allowed, with all due respect to my colleagues in this room, presentation of these papers and studies that would never pass the rigors of a peer review journal if they were on any other subject other than vaccines. I’ve watched junk science allow GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) to publish a paper on their MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine in which 10% of these healthy 12-month old babies ended up in an emergency room in 6 weeks. Two and half percent of them developed a new chronic medical condition. But that’s all okay. Not because they compared that vaccine to a placebo group or delayed vaccine group, but because they compared it to the current M-M-R® II vaccine (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live). That is the moral equivalent of comparing 10 shots of whiskey to 9 shots of whiskey and a shot of vodka and saying vodka doesn’t cause intoxication. Junk science also allows us to take vaccines which don’t work to just double down. Increase the dose. Increase the frequency. I saw this committee in the last meeting look at the pneumococcal vaccine and say, “It doesn’t work” and yet leave it on the schedule and leave it up to us to determine whether or not we give it to a patient. I’m sorry, but that’s your job. Please, do your job. We already know the mumps vaccine is of questionable efficacy. We know that flu vaccine at best will prevent 50% of the cases of flu in healthy adults. We know that the MMR vaccine will wear off and we’ll have adults who are susceptible to measles. We stand on the threshold of a public health crisis and vaccines are part of that. But, you guys can make a difference. If we don’t change the course of where we’re at right now, we will have nothing but chronically ill children and adults. We’ll have epidemics of autoimmunity, of autism, of infertility, of asthma, of food allergies, of cancer. But, you could change that. Demand better science. Demand better adjuvants. Demand better vaccines. I thank you.",1,0,0,3,"But I’m not here today to debate the safety and efficacy of vaccines.

OCT,2019,Ms. Helen Woods,Alabama Coalition for Vaccine Rights (ACVR) ,"Hello. I’m not here today to introduce myself to all of you in hopes that you remember me, or my name, or my story. I’m not here today to tell you all how I used to blindly believe in the mantra that “vaccines save lives” and that vaccine science was true and heroic. I did not come to recant the heartbreaking story of how I had my eyes painfully pried open to the stark reality of just how dangerous vaccines are, or how those dangers manifested themselves to me by way of my own children suffering. I did not come here to thank you all for your hard work, your time, or your consideration. I’m not here to beg you all to listen to my emotional testimony and show you pictures of my damaged children with the hopes that just maybe one of you would hear this mother and begin to do the right thing. Many that have spoken before me in the meetings past talk about the ability you all have to stand on the right side of history with us and how each of you have been given a high calling. Each of us that come here three times a year are here to acknowledge the weight that each of you carry, but our cries always fall on deaf ears. We ourselves are not acknowledged and that is why I’m here today, because I have been given a high calling. I am a mother, and so I am here speaking to you as a mother—not because I’m some truth warrior, justice seeker, or motivational speaker that was paid to be here. I am here for my children and their children and so on. This battle for vaccine truth is just a single fight in the great war between good and evil. As a mother, God gave charge of his three precious souls to me during my time on this rock. With that calling is my obligation to speak the truth as I have found it and always, always teach my children to stand up for what you believe in—to stand up with a loud voice against the lie and to be brave. So, it is not for your or anyone else’s amusement that I am here today, but only to show my children in the way that they should go so that they might not err from that truth. Vaccines do not save lives. You are all not an authority on my children or how God charged me to raise them when he gave them to me. I do not and will not beg for your acknowledgement or exposure of a corrupt system for which you yourselves are already entangled in and serve diligently. I am not here to educate you all on the data of vaccine injuries, because that data comes three times a year here to fill this room. You still don’t  listen. All of you already know the truth just as I do and just as my children learned. I am here to speak because I was given this opportunity to be brave. As I would want my children to stand and fight for whatever truth needs defending when their time comes, here I am standing in my own time. Vaccines do not save lives, but you all already knew that.

OCT,2019,Ms. Amy Gordon,Body Centered Asheville ,"From the real frontlines, parents have had it. Over 54% of our children are now diagnosed with chronic illness and 1 in 6 has a developmental disability. This is a spike that you, the CDC, just publicly noted. Your responses are: 1) add more vaccines to the schedule; and 2) promote greater and greater uptake of vaccines. If you want us to take you seriously, you need to: 1) stop insulting our intelligence; 2) be completely transparent with the public about vaccine side effects; and 3) address our concerns. Believe me, parents have many. A dozen people get sick from eating Romaine lettuce and it’s pulled from the shelves. When a 2-month old baby dies within hours of getting 8 different vaccines at a well-child visit, nothing is done and parents are told that it’s a “complete coincidence.” Your message is that saving Americans from produce is more important than investigating countless infant deaths and what’s causing our country’s escalating infant mortality rate. These parents are waking up to the fact that vaccines are the leading cause of unexamined coincidence worldwide. Just last week, the media was filled with reports of baby food containing heavy metals, and there was outrage. Officials are now calling for a federal probe. Yet somehow, we’re supposed to believe that those same metals in vaccines are magically safe? When parents access mainstream scientific journals, they find overwhelming evidence that these same heavy metals in vaccines can cause significant neurological damage to our children. Last week, the media also reported on chicken pox popping up in a New York State (NYS) school system despite the expulsion this year of all unvaccinated or partially unvaccinated students. A letter from the school was issued stating, “You can still get chicken pox when you’re vaccinated” and that “getting chicken pox naturally provides lifelong immunity from the virus.” That leaves parents with many more questions than answers. The CDC website says that your committee’s role is to look at the safety and efficacy of a vaccine before it’s recommended. However, watching the video of your committee unanimously recommending the new HepB vaccine even in light of fetal cardiac events dramatically undermines our confidence in who you serve. What the American public sees is your absolute unwillingness to have a fact-based, honest dialogue around vaccine benefits and risks that moves beyond the mantra of “safe and effective.” Yet when everyday people like myself ask questions about safety and efficacy, we’re labeled “anti-vaccine” and listed as one of the top 10 threats to global health. You have created an army of pissed off parents, pissed off grandparents, and angry citizens who value their health and value their medical freedom. You have, indeed, awakened a sleeping giant and we are filled with unyielding resolve.

OCT,2019,Laura Moretti ,Concerned Parent ,"Hi. Good morning. I have a couple of quotes for you. Albert Einstein said, “The important thing is to not stop questioning. Curiosity exists for a reason.” Euripides said, “Question everything. Learn something. Answer nothing.” I’m very grateful today to be here and have this opportunity to speak in front of you. I notice that you all have very important jobs. In your description that is listed, it is required for you to “have the ability to evaluate complex issues and weigh conflicting opinions.” You are required to “have high standards of impartiality, integrity, and objectivity so that you can provide guidance for a safe vaccine.” Today, I am questioning the safety of the CDC recommendations. As a former law enforcement officer and a detective, I have been concerned at the growing numbers of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) deaths specifically when the numbers show that it primarily happens at 2 months and 4 months of age. Upon interviewing these parents, they know nothing about VAERS. It also is very concerning that they just vaccinated them within 2 weeks to hours of death. It’s primarily 2 weeks. It’s very concerning. I also find it very alarming that there are no studies that consist of saline placebos or double-blind placebos. There are no vaccinated and unvaccinated studies, except for the ones with the deceiving labels. Again, if you investigate them, you’ll see that it was deceiving. There are no long-term health outcome studies. I find that very alarming. I’m surprised that you don’t. I do appreciate that a couple of you have some questions. I also must remind you that the United States (US) has the highest rate of infant mortality in all of the developed nations, yet we are the most highly vaccinated at the youngest ages. But, I suppose it’s just coincidence. My question for you today is, again, are you standing by your word and oath as your job description today? Are you demanding better and safer vaccines? Vaccine injuries are not rare and death and injuries are real. Vaccines should never be mandated. I have two more quotes for you. Let’s see if you can decide who they’re from, okay? Let’s take a guess, “The state must declare the child to be the most precious treasure of the people. As long as the government is perceived as working for the benefit of the children, the people will happily endure almost any curtailment of liberty and almost any deprivation.” That’s the first quote. The second quote is, “If you tell a big enough lie and you tell it frequent enough, it will be believed.” Just like the lie of “vaccines are safe and effective.” Guess who those were by? Hitler. Adolph Hitler. And everybody like him. Everybody liked him.",1,0,0,1,"Today, I am questioning the safety of the CDC recommendations.","SIDS, autism, placebo, children",0,0,0,0,0,
OCT,2019,Dr. Litjen (LJ) Tan,"Chief Strategy Officer,Immunization Action Coalition (IAC)","Thank you Mr. Chair and Madame Secretary for this opportunity to comment. Good morning, everybody. My name is LJ Tan and I am the Chief Strategy Officer for the Immunization Action Coalition or IAC. IAC works to prevent disease by working on state and national policy to improve the implementation of safe and effective immunization services across the country, and by creating and distributing educational materials for health professionals and the public that support the delivery of these important immunization services. We also work to increase immunization rates and prevent disease through facilitating factual and evidence-based communication about the safety and efficacy of vaccines within the broad immunization community. As part of that work, I Co-Chair the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit (NAIIS), a partnership of more than 130 national and regional stakeholders committed to protecting the lives of children and adults through increasing the awareness and implementation of ACIP recommendations on the ground. The Summit is a strong proponent of the Immunization Neighborhood where all providers who touch a patient have responsibility in ensuring that the patient is properly immunized be it through communication, collaboration, or coordination of services. IAC recognizes the difficult work ACIP does in balancing the multiple factors of cost-effectiveness, process, implementation, and evolving science while ensuring that the country’s vaccination programs are safe and effective as they are now. We commend and thank the members of the ACIP for their dedication and service. This was so well-evidenced in your discussion and in your vote on the two immunization schedules that will occur tomorrow. IAC urges the ACIP to also consider the wealth of knowledge and experience within the stakeholders that are represented by the state Immunization Coalitions and within the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit. They remain ready and willing partners to service focus groups and to provide feedback on implementation of recommendations from the ACIP as they rollout across the country. They’re also strong partners on the ground to increase understanding and awareness of ACIP recommendations to providers across the country. Indeed, to facilitate implementation of immunizations, IAC has just designed an elegant new “Vaccines Save Lives” pin on hard black enamel with gold lettering and edges. And just in time for the flu season, IAC is also pleased to announce its new flu vaccine buttons and stickers. These are modeled after “I Voted” stickers, which are given to voters in many states as they leave the poles. These flu vaccine buttons and stickers are bright red to help broadcast this important vaccination message. Wear these pins on clothing, uniforms, lab coats, tote bags, backpacks to show that you value vaccinations. We also have stickers that you can give to your patients. If you have any questions, please reach out to any of the 5 IAC persons here: Myself; our Executive Director, Dr. Deborah Wexler; Dr. Sharon Humiston; Laurel Wood; and Julie Murphy. We have been passing out free samples, and on the table outside, there are flyers on how to get them online.

OCT,2019,"Donna Dreyer, RN ","Registered Nurse, PAVE","Good morning. My name is Donna Dreyer and I’m a Registered Nurse (RN) in California and North Carolina, with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree. I’m also a mumps and chicken pox survivor. No offense, but I’m guessing by looking at each of you on the panel before me, many of you could say that the same thing—that you not only survived, but have thrived through many of these same childhood illnesses. I came into this profession with the anticipation I would help people to recover and heal from their medical issues. Sadly, the longer that I’m in this career, the more I’ve experienced dissolution with a system that is very broken. A system that can hardly be called “health care,” but instead has become “sick care” doing damage control. We no longer treat people as individuals. We are a system that focuses on masking symptoms by prescribing a cocktail of pills for them to be on for the rest of their lives. Medicine and healthcare should not be considered a one-size-fits-all practice. No drug is 100% safe 100% of the time for 100% of the people. We are one of the most heavily vaccinated nations in the world, and the effects of health outcomes in the United States speak for themselves. One only needs to look at our ranking with other developed nations to see how sadly we are failing. It is a known and embarrassing fact that among developed countries, the US has a much higher mortality rate at birth. What we should be asking is, “Why?” Why? Because vaccines never have and never will equate to optimal health. True health is not gained by injecting immune suppressing toxins like heavy metals, carcinogens, allergens, inflammatory chemicals, animal and insect cells, and male and female human DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) components. True health does not come in a syringe or a pill. There is a time and place for government oversight of the healthcare practices in our country. Good medicine begins with doctors who are being exposed to the whole truth and who are free to practice without unfounded constraints from the government. Corporations have no place in running our government and/or our health care system. Please, prove us wrong and restore the public’s confidence once again in the pharmaceutical products you support as vital to good health. Ensure those double-blind inert placebo studies are conducted and the results addressed appropriately. Let’s look at immunity post-vaccination. Compare vaxed versus un-vaxed health outcomes. Submit statistical analysis of test data to be reviewed by independent audit. Return liability to the vaccine makers like every other drug manufacturer has.

OCT,2019,Jennifer Coe,Concerned Public Attendee ,"My name is Jennifer. I want to start off by saying I appreciate all of you that are here today on both sides of the rope. I know it’s a difficult thing to take time out of our busy schedules to be here. It’s a sacrifice for most of us. I also want you to know that I respect your positions on this panel. I truly feel that most of you are here because you want to help people. This is not my first ACIP meeting. I came here in February with a truly open mind and I left here concrete and more steadfast that ever in my decision to stop vaccinating my son. You see, I come from a slightly different view than many other x-vaxers. My son was vaccinated according to your schedule up until 15 months of age, with the exception of the MMR. He will never get that vaccine. Dallas is not vaccine-injured. Following some “common” reactions, an acquaintance of mine came along side of me and gently encouraged me to delve in deeper to vaccines, their ingredients, their side-effects, what’s listed on the insert—not the fact sheet that you’re given, and into genetic mutations for which my son had several markers. She didn’t tell me what to believe. She didn’t tell me that vaccines are poison. I’d be lying if I told you that I stopped vaccinating at that point. I didn’t. I’m not the type to do anything because anybody tells me to or not to do it. I continued with your schedule, but I requested that our doctor order some tests on my son that determined that he did, in fact, have some genetic mutations. It was at that moment that I knew we were done. I was no longer going to play “Russian Roulette” with my son’s life and his health. My son can’t detox as efficiently as some people and is, thus, predisposed to vaccine injury by the ingredients in your vaccines. I immediately reached out and sought the knowledge of parents who have gone before me. I learned how to help my son detox from the 15 months’ worth of toxins that were injected into him with my permission, but without any true informed consent. Dallas will be 5 in December. He has been at a sitter with school-aged children since he was 2 years old. He is currently in preschool. He is healthier than any of the other daycare kids, all of his cousins, and any of my friends with kids who are close in age and fully vaccinated. In 4 years, he has only been on an antibiotic one time and that was for strep throat last winter. I owe my son’s health to the parents and grandparents sitting around me here today and to the thousands of other parents who actively encourage people to do their own research and come to their own conclusions before it’s too late for their loved ones. These are the ones who were your post-market data. These are the ones who are fighting for their loved, my loved ones, your loved ones. I trust what they have seen, what they’ve witnessed with their own eyes, over the blind trust that I have seen you folks have here in the pharmaceutical industry hands down. I came here and I listened, I followed the process, and I was appalled. You have lost my trust and my confidence. Not because anybody on social media or Google told me not to trust you, but because you have lost sight of your initial oath to “do no harm.” Parents and grandparents are screaming from the rooftops about their children and family members who have been harmed by vaccines and the insane current schedule. Yet, their cries seem to fall on your deaf ears. I pray that each of you will find the courage and strength to stand up and ask the tough questions, challenge the data presented to you by the pharmaceutical reps who sound like used car salesmen, and repair your severely damaged reputation. Our future generations depend on you. Be strong and do your job.

OCT,2019,Elijah Bunch ,#NeverForgetChris ,"Thank you for the time for allowing me to be up here today. It has been barely a year since my son, Christopher, passed away. It still hurts today just as much as it did a year ago. My heart is still as broken as it was the day I had to leave the hospital without my son. I’m not the same as I was. My life has forever been changed. Merck made that happen. Our government made that happen. And you, the CDC, made that happen. Your vote killed my son. The HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine killed the most precious gift in the world—My son. My best friend. I had the joy of watching him grow up for 14 years. I got to love him for 14 years. I got to be his father for 14 years. I will never stop fighting for my son and I will never stop telling his story. Unless you have lost a son and had to watch him lie in a hospital bed for 6 days and die, you have no clue what pain is. The day my son died is the day half of my heart died. The HPV vaccine destroyed our lives. I will never forget the last look my son gave me the last time I felt his warm hands—the last time I felt his heartbeat. That is pain. While I stand here today, I do it with a broken heart that I will forever have to live with. My family time is now spent with my son by visiting at the cometary. Do you know what it feels like to have to walk into a room with people that you have known for years and have them stop talking because you walked in? Do you know what it feels like to be the parent of a healthy child, because you chose to follow and trust the schedule that you guys made, and then he suddenly dies? Do you know what it feels like to be that same parent trying to understand why and how you don’t see what is happening to our children? Well, I do. I hope that the next time you vote on the HPV vaccine, you remember my son—you remember the story about my son that I am telling you here today. Think of how you would feel if this happened to your brother, your sister, or your child. I wanted to speak with you guys today because I have a voice and I have to be my son’s voice. So, I hope that you guys take this into your hearts and into your minds and remember what we said here today. Thank you very much.

OCT,2019,Julie Murphy,Immunization Action Coalition ,"Hi. This is Julie Murphy. I work at the Immunization Action Coalition in St. Paul. I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Bunch. It is difficult to speak after hearing that. I’m here because I want to thank you in this room, the members of ACIP, liaisons, and all people who participate in the working groups. Thank you for the work that you do not only in this room, but year-round. I truly appreciate it. I am the mother of a fully vaccinated young woman. This group is part of the safety net of scientists, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and more. As a single parent, I was grateful to have a group like you, a group of experts, who could ensure that the childhood recs at that time and now the adult recs for her are safe and effective. If I had not chosen to vaccinate Allie, I can’t help but think what it might feel like if in 5 years she were diagnosed with a cancer that had a vaccine that could prevent it. If she looked at me with her eyes and said, “Wait a second. There was something that you could have done to prevent this and you didn’t?” I don’t know if could live with myself. But because of those of you in this room, I did choose to vaccinate her. I vaccinate for more than myself and my daughter. I do it for others in the community. I have a nephew who has cystic fibrosis. I see his daily struggles, the struggles of his family, the multiple surgeries, the dozens of pills, the nightly feeding tube. He can’t fight illness by himself. He needs and relies on a community that is fully vaccinated so that he can remain healthy and live the fullest life that he can lead. I choose to vaccinate because vaccines do save lives. To all of you on this side of the Rock Star—I choose to call this the “Rock Star Boundary.” You are rock stars and you are my heroes. Thank you so much for the time and effort that you put into this day in and day out, not just 3 or 4 times a year.

OCT,2019,Catie Clobes ,Health Choice MN ,"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today. For those who are on your computers while a man talks about this dead son, you should be ashamed of yourselves. I’m here to talk about Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, now commonly known as “Undetermined, Unknown, Natural Causes, and even Positional Asphyxiation.” SIDS has a well-developed relationship to vaccines. I’ve read study after study about SIDS and vaccines, and what has stood out to me the most is the common denominator in all of these studies. Most of them end up a hypothesis and the investigation that the conclusion of the study demands is never completed. Why? You have known about this for decades—known that some vaccine components can trigger a lethal outcome in babies, that some vaccine components can produce a range of cytokines that cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and suppress an underdeveloped medulla, inducing a SIDS episodes in a vulnerable adult, infant, or child. In the past 8 months, I’ve spoken with several of the best neuropathologists in the world. One doesn’t even specialize in SIDS. He specializes in chronic traumatic encephalopathy in football players and even he knew that hypersensitivity to certain proteins in vaccines can cause a fatal outcome in an infant and explained to me the simple testing that needed to be done after separating the serum from the blood post-mortem and running cytokine tests on that serum. Any medical examiner (ME) can run these tests, yet they don’t. You know about this. They know about this. Why don’t we now about this? “We” being the parents of these infants. Because on February 27, 2019 if my doctor had told me, “Now some infants have vulnerabilities to the point that death can occur, certainly after vaccines,” I would have grabbed my daughter and got the hell out of there. Then the morning of March 1st, a mere 36 hours later, I would not have found her cold, pale, lifeless body. Then I wouldn’t be dealing with a corrupt medical examiner who refused to do any additional testing on my daughter, saying it wasn’t medically necessary. She never even examined her brain and when I hired second opinions who found things, she falsified documents and changed my daughter’s cause of death (COD) to “Positional Asphyxiation” based on no evidence and despite expert opinions stating that it was because of my desire to petition vaccine court. She’s a lunatic. Many parents have reached out to me with similar stories of inadequate autopsies and discriminations. If medical examiners and doctors are not investigating, how is the committee supposed to know if their recommendations are even safe? Because my daughter was not collateral damage for the greater good. Her name was Evee. Evee Gayle. She was six and a half months old. She was beautiful. She looked just like a little doll from the day she was born. She had these piercing eyes that glowed, this gorgeous smile, and a laugh that could end a war. She was well-developed, well-nourished, and flawless in health. She was my best friend, one of three loves of my life, and my heart feels like it’s not even there most days since my love story with her ended. Her name was Evee Gayle Clobes and she did not die from co-sleeping with her mother 36 hours after she received 6 vaccines. Your recommended schedule killed my daughter.
